You see the very core of the Russian Federation the Moscow region is simply indefensible. There are no mountains ranges, no rivers or oceans there are no swamps or deserts, only the Moscow forests and the inhospitable climate can be described as a geographic obstacle. The only thing the Russians can do in event of an invasion is drag out the war and bleed the enemy out. It is for this reason that Russia's history is largely about surviving invasion after invasion. Thes centuries long experience left the deep mark in the Russian culture and psychology and due to these experiences, the Russian leadership became obsessed with security and survival."*

- [x] [Boris Yeltsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VqLWtJEJs) - *Yeltsin transformed Russia's socialist economy into a capitalist market economy, implementing economic shock therapy, market exchange rate of the ruble, nationwide privatization and lifting of price controls. Yeltsin proposed a new Russian constitution which was popularly approved at the 1993 constitutional referendum. However, due to the sudden total economic shift, a majority of the national property and wealth fell into the hands of a small number of oligarchs. Rather than creating new enterprises, Yeltsin's policies led to international monopolies hijacking the former Soviet markets, arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market.* - [The Legacy of Boris Yeltsin, *the reality remains that few Russians will mourn Yeltsin’s departure. For the Russia which he wanted to created was not born. And his legacy, although important, has created the problems which the world faces with Russia today. Yeltsin was a great man, who also left a great deal of problems...Yeltsin is now accused by many ordinary Russians – including the current leaders in Moscow - for “giving up” on the Soviet Union, without getting anything in return from the West. The accusation is grotesque. By the time he became leader, the Soviet Union disintegrating; he was in no position to bargain, or extract any concessions. Gorbachev “lost” Eastern Europe; Yeltsin merely accepted that the Soviet Union was “lost” as well. The only way Yeltsin could have kept the empire together was by using military force. Wisely, Yeltsin never even considered that option, although it is doubtful that the Soviet armed forces would have been able to keep the country together, even if they were ordered to. Either way, for the first time in world history, an empire disappeared within weeks, without firing a shot...most of Yeltsin’s other activities had turned out to be big failures, and this was evident while he was still in government. The Russian leader granted his people a large degree of freedom: media and cultural activities exploded, and people suddenly felt liberated. But there was no attempt to create a coherent civil society, and no effort to portray Russia as a new liberating experience, after the horrible years of the Soviet Union...No leader can work miracles, single-handedly. But Yeltsin did not even try very hard. More importantly, the country’s resources were distributed – in a “spontaneous privatization” among a handful of people; that is how Russia’s so-called “oligarchs” were created..*](https://www.rusi.org/publication/legacy-boris-yeltsin)

During his six years in power, Gorbachev introduced at least 10 programs for the “radical restructuring” of the Soviet economy, not a one of which was implemented. Instead, economic reform was limited to inconsistent and incoherent half-measures...One of the most important insights in modern political economy is the potential conflict between good economics and good politics. In democratic regimes, where politicians depend on votes and campaign contributions to remain in office, research has shown that the logic of politics produces a shortsightedness with regard to economic policy. Popular economic policies are those that tend to yield short-term and easily identifiable benefits at the expense of long-term and largely hidden costs...If market reforms had been introduced sincerely by Gorbachev, the short-term prospects would have been higher prices as consumer subsidies were eliminated, unemployment as inefficient state enterprises were shut down, and overt income inequality as new entrepreneurs took advantage of opportunities for economic profit. In other words, structural economic reform promised short-term and easily identifiable costs to be borne mainly by the party bureaucracy, and long-term and largely hidden benefits in terms of increased economic efficiency and consumer well-being. The logic of reform was in direct conflict with the logic of politics, and politics won out...Glasnost, in addition to the events of 1989—from Tiananmen Square to the Berlin Wall—mobilized the intellectual and cultural elite.*"](https://fee.org/articles/why-perestroika-failed/) - ["*While it took several years for the economic and political reforms of perestroika to take effect, the new transparency under glasnost happened almost immediately. Shocking revelations about past abuses under the Soviet system came to light...There is little doubt that these reforms, intended to strengthen the economy and transform the political system, instead undermined the foundation of the Soviet Union...It could have ended with an explosion, and with blood, like the Yugoslav model where the thing fell apart, and the various pieces, republics, began warring with each other. Gorbachev managed, or is responsible for, the relatively peaceful end of an empire...Gorbachev wanted something like the Marshall Plan, and Bush refused to give it. Bush might have worried that the aid would go down the drain. But at the end, when Gorbachev desperately needed economic assistance in a big way, Bush wouldn’t provide it. That decision had consequences that linger today. Taubman believes that this period marked the only time in the last century that America had a Russian or Soviet partner that was truly willing to be an ally, making it a missed opportunity of huge proportions.*"](https://www.history.com/news/did-perestroika-cause-the-fall-of-the-soviet-union)

Wages were growing faster than the output of consumer goods and foodstuffs. This factor was creating a chronic shortage of goods...By mid-1991, no funds had been left in the Soviet government’s budget to subsidize state prices...the Gaidar team decided that the country might be confronted with a hunger without the immediate price liberalization...On December 3, 1991, Yeltsin signed a decree on price liberalization. The decree set free the wholesale and retail prices of most goods and services, except for a small group of socially essential items (sugar, salt, some types of bread, gasoline, vodka, milk and others)...Retail price regulation was finally terminated in Russia in 1995 after exemptions from Yeltsin’s price liberalization decree were cancelled...Gaidar and other liberal economists assessed positively as a whole the decision to switch to market prices. In their opinion, this measure helped save the country from hunger and even prevent a civil war. They considered high inflation and a plunge in household incomes as something inevitable.*](https://tass.com/economy/916534) - [Four Reformers in Russia’s Shock Therapy](https://geohistory.today/russia-shock-therapy/)

This was one of the motivations that  Putin had for the Russo-Ukrainian War. If Russia exacerbates tensions between Kyiv and Luhansk and Donetsk, NATO will be unwilling to make Ukraine a full partner. Indeed, the current war is history repeating itself. 14 years earlier, Georgia was  getting close to joining NATO. That required settling issues  with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But Russia made this impossible by invading. And thus there is no Georgia in NATO today."* / *"Cyprus is out as well. This, oddly enough, involves another NATO member. In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus. The war lasted a month until some lines were drawn on maps. Since then, Cyprus has been de facto split into regular Cyprus and Northern Cyprus. That alone would be a problem. But to make matters worse, Turkish forces  have aided Northern Cyprus since that time, which adds an extra layer of complication  because of Turkey’s veto power."*

        - *"..**You know, it was quite understandable to Gorbachev and his entourage that the country needed changes.Today, i can say with all confidence they didn't understand what changes were necessary and how to achieve them. ..This is not Gorbachev's idea. This idea of utopia was put forward by the French socialists, so Gorbachev has nothing to do with this. I reiterate Gorbachev's merit is that he felt the need for change. That's true. And he tried to change the system. But the problem is this system was not efficient in its roots. How could you radically change the situation and the system while preserving the country? That's something noone knew back then, including Gorbachev. And they pushed the country towards a collapse.**."*
        - *"..**I often hear criticism addressed to me that i regret the collapse of Soviet Union. First of all, most important thing is that after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, 25 million Russians found themselves abroad in one night. And that was one of the greatest catastrrophies of the 20th century. People used to live in one country. In a blink of the eye they found themselves abroad.**.."*
        - *"..**You know, i don't think i have the right to give any assessment to Gorbachev or the peronality of Yeltsin. Just like any of us, he had his problems, but he also had his strengths. And one of them is that he never avoided personal responsibility. He knew how to assume responsibility.**...I don't know why Yeltsin chose me. But when Yeltsin offered me the job first time, i refused...**And to assume responsibility for Russia back then was a very difficult thing to do.**.."*
        - *"...**I didn't stop the privatisation. I just wanted to make it more equitable, more fair. I did everything so that state property was not sold for free. We put an end to some schemes, which led to the creation of oligarchs. These schemes allowed some people to become billionaires in a flash. And it also led to a situation where the Government either lost control of strategic industries or just led to the destruction of the industries. So my goal was not to stop the privatisation, but to make it more sytemic, more equitable.**.."*
        - *"...Do you know what they say among the Russian people? **They say that those who are destined to be hanged are not going to drown.**.."*
        - *"...**But there is great difference between us. Ronald Reagan was the head of the United States. And be that as it may, his difficulties in the US, were not comparable to those we faced in Russia at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of 2000...Almost being broke and actually being broke are two entirely different things...Incidentally, Russia not only paid back its debt to IMF, we also paid back the debts of all the former Soviet Republics.**."*
        - *"...**When the decision was taken for the unification of Germany, and on the subsequent withdrawal of Soviet troops in Eastern Europe, the dignitaries in the United States and NATO secretary General, they were all saying that the one thing that Soviet Union could be sure of was that the Eastern border of NATO would not be extended any further than the Eastern border of the German Democratic Republic. It was a mistake made by Mr Gorbachev. In politics, everything must be enshrined in paper. He just talked, and he decided that was enough....NATO was set up during the period when there was a confrontation between two blocs, the Eastern and Western blocs. Now the Warsaw Treaty has faded away, there is no longer an Eastern bloc, no more Soviet Union. Therefore, why does NATO keep existing? My impression is that in order to justify its existence, NATO has a ned of an external foe, there is a constant search for the foe or some acts of provocation to name someone as an adversary.**.."*
        - *"...**The unipolar world that had been proposed after the Cold War did not take place either..However, what is a unipolar world? However, one might embelish this term, at the end of the day, it refers to one type of situation, namely one center of authority, one center of force, one center of decision making. It is a world in which there is one master, one severeign, and at the end of the day, this is pernicious not only for those within the system, but for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself within..One state and of course, first and foremost the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way. This is visible in the economic, political, cultural and educational policies it emposes on other nations..."*
        - *"..**Nowadays, NATO is a mere instrument of foreign policy of the US. It has no allies, it has only vassals. Once a country becomes a MATO member, it is hard to resist the pressures of the US. And allof a sudden anly weapon system can be placed in this country...And what are we supposed to do? In this case, we have to take countermeasures..The situation becomes more tense...Why are we so acutely responding to the expansion of NATO?..We are concerned by the practice of how decisions are taken....I said 'We would condier an option that Russia might join NATO.'. Clinton said 'Why not?'. But the US delegation got very nervous.**.."*
        - *"..**You see, our openness to all our partners, including towards the US, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and change in our political system was so great that it even covered our Nuclear forces. We had almost no secrets back then...I believe that if you think you are the only world power, trying to impose whole nation the idea of their exclusiveness, this creates an imperialistic mentality in society, which in turn requires an adequate foreign policy expected by society. And in practice this might go contrary to the interests of the Americans. That's the way i see it.Because in the end, it leads to problems and deficiencies. And it demonstrates it is impossible to control everything...After WW2, a bipolar world order emerged. I think it was a strategic mistake of the Soviet Union and quite frankly Soviet Union was at that time behaving quite primitively and they gave the US excuse to create NATO and to launch the Cold War. I think the US felt they were fore-front of the so-called civilised world and when the Soviet Union collapsed, they were under the illusion that they were capable of anything. That's always a trap. Because in this situation, the person or the country began to make mistakes. There is no need to analyse situations, or think about the consequences. And the country becomes inefficient. I think that's the trap the US has found itself in.**.."*

So what is the point in expanding NATO? Against who? In order to ensure the security of many countries, if they feel threatened, it is not necessary to expand NATO. You can conclude bilateral agreements on mutual assistance and security. There is no need to create an image of an adversary. There have been two expansion waves of NATO. After that, the US has inilaterally withdrawn from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (2001). And they are always saying to us that we should not be concerned by that, this is not a threat to Russia. Allegedly they did that to counter the threat of Iran. But right now the Iranian issue has gone. A treaty has been signed. Iran has renounced any military nuclear programs. The US has agreed to that. They said that they have signed the relevant document. But the anti-ballistic missile development program is underway in Europe-some of its elements are to be stationed there. Against whom are they doing this? And this requires a response from Russia.**."*

        - *"...**And as for religious conflicts between Islam, Christianity  and Judaism, we've never had those. Our Islamic community are all citizens of Russia, they have no other home. Russia is their motherland.....As to the inter-ethnic relations, this has always been a delicate issue - whenever, wherever. But Russia has certain advantages in this regard. For example, take Europe and US of today and you'll see that people with other religions are mostly immigrants. Russia is different. Those people with other religions are Russians. And it is their homeland and they have none other. From the very beginning, Russia was emerging as a multi-religious and multi-ethnic country. And over a thousand years, we've nurtured a certain culture of interaction. And those places where mixed poplulations live - Christians and Muslims - there are many situations when people side-by-side celebrate both Muslim feast days and Christian holidays. And i think that based on these huge positive experiences, we will be able to surmount quite easily all those things - sensitive delicate issues of inter-ethnic and inter-religious interactions.**."*
        - *"...**I was not the one to do it, the Russian people did that themselves. This renaissance is due to the fact that the communist ideology ceased to existand that left an idelological vacuum and this vacuum could only be filled with religion....There are no chairs, Orthodox mass is served standing up. That is the tradition of Russian Orthodox...Sometimes you kneel.**.."*
        - *"...And secondly trying to spy on your allies, if you really consider them as allies and not vassals, is just indecent. Because it undermines trust. And it means that in the end it deals damage to your own national security.....Regretably this is the existing practice of how the intelligence services work today. I understand how the world works. But spying on your own allies, that is just inadmissable..."*
        - *...**As to the democratic character of the Russian state - for almost a thousand years our country was constructed as a monarchy and then the so-called Revolution of 1917 occured. Stalin found himself at the helm of the state. Only at the beginning of the 1990s, events came to pass that lay the foundation of a new stage of the Russian development. Certainly it cannot be expected that we would instantenously have the same democratic model as in the US, Germany or France. Societies, like every living organism, must develop stage by stage gradually,that's the normal development process.**."*

        - *"...**And certainly the people were fed up with all those arbitrary actions and all the crazy corruption, the impoverishment, and the illegal enrichment of other people. Certainly the people thought that moving in any way toward the EU would liberate them from the terrible conditions they had found themselves in starting from the 1990s. That was the driving force behind the developments in Ukraine...The economies of Russia and Ukraine were emerging as a united economy and had unique economic relations..The markets of Russia were absolutely open to imports from Ukraine**.."*
        - *"...**For 17 years we had been in negotiations with EU on the conditions of Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization and all of a sudden, it was announced to us that Ukraine and the EU were signing an association agreement. And that meant the opening up of the Ukrainian markets. The EU would be able to enter our territory with all of their goods without any negotiations, despite the agreements - principled agreements - which we had reached with them before, during those 17 year talks on our accession to the WTO. Certainly we had to respond to that, and we said that if Ukraine had decided to act like that, it was all their choice. But this didn't mean that we had to pay for this choice. Why do people living in Russia today have to pay for this choice the Ukrainian leadership has made? We proposed that we hold talks with our European partners in a trilateral format. But there was a flat refusal. They told us that we had better stay out of it.**.."*
        - *"...**We were not the ones to annex Crimea. The citizens of Crimea decided to join Russia. The legitimate parliament of Crimea which was elected based on Ukrainian legislation announced a referandum. The Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, voted to join Russia. Yes, we created conditions for people to go to polling stations, but we did not engage any hostilities. No one was shooting and no one was killed. More than 90% of the Crimean population, turned out, they voted, and once the ballot was cast, the Parliament, based on the outcome of referandum, addressed the Russian parliament, asking it to incorporate it into the Russian Federation...Moreover, Ukraine lost the territory, not due to Russia's position, but due to the position assumed by those who are living in Crimea.**.."*
        - *"...**I am convinced that we are not simply related to the Ukrainian people, we are almost the same. Their language, culture, and history must be respected, and even when we were the same country we respected their differences. Suffice it to say that for many years the leaders of the Soviet Union were of Ukraine descent. I think that says a lot.**.."*
        - *"...**Right now a certain strengtening of American influence is being witnessed in Europe, partly due to the Eastern Europen countries, because they are trying to resist the former dominating power of the Soviet Union. Right now it's mirrored in Russia, but sooner or later this is going to stop...Through initiating the crisis in Ukraine, they've (the Americans) managed to stimulate such an attitude towards Russia, viewing Russia as an enemy, a possible potential aggressor....that there is no threat whatsoever emanating from Russia, either to the Baltic countries, or to Eastern Europe, or to Western Europe. And the stronger this misunderstanding is the greater the desire is going to be to protect their (European) sovereignity and to fend for their national interests...So this constant feeling of being under pressure, let me assure you, is something no one is happy about. Sooner or later this is going to have consequences if it's going to stop.**..."*
        - *"...**And it's better if this happens through dialogue....but i think what is needed right now is the transition to a new paradigm, a new philosophy for building relations among countries. And this paradigm should be based on respect for the interests of other countries, for the sovereignity of other people, not just trying to intimidate them using some outer threat which can only be resisted with the help of the US. This paradigm will have to cease to exist sooner or later**..."*

        - *"...**Since the early 1990s, we have assumed that tha Cold War is over. We thought there was no need to take any additional protective measures, because we viewed ourselves as an integral part of the world community. We didn't have any equipment of our own. Our companies, our state institutions and administrative departments, they were buying everything - hardware and software. And we've got much equipment from the US, from Europe, and that equipment is used by the Intelligence Services and by the Defense Ministry. But recently we certainly have become aware of the threat that all of that poses. Only during recent years, have we started to think about how we can ensure technological independence, as well as security. Certainly we give it much thought, and we take appropriate measures....So the trust and openness of Russia, they were unprecedented. Unfortunately US didn't recognise that, they didn't want to take note of that and appreciate it.**."*
        - *"....**This process had been a long one. We had to catch up with the others. We've got a very good foundation. We have a very high education level and very good school of mathematics...And right now some of our Russian companies get $7 billion dollars or so yearly. They've become competitive in the software market, and they are also quite active in pursuing the hardware...We see supercomputers being built.**."*
        - *"....**Maybe when there is action, there is always a counteraction...You know, there was one prominent politician of the past, Winston Churchill. He was very firmly against Sovietism, but once the WWII started, he was a great advocate of working together with the Soviet Union, and he called Stalin a great war leader and revolutionary. And after WWII, as is well known, it was Churchill who initiated the Cold War. And when the Soviet Union made the first nuclear test, it was none other than Winston Churchill who announced the need for a co-existence of two systems. He was a very flexible person. But i think that deep down in his heart, his attitude toward Stalin never wavered, never changed....Stalin was a product of his era. You can demonise him however much you like. We try to talk about his merits in achiving victory over Fascism. Asd to his demonisation, there was such a person in history as Oliver Cromwell. He was a bloodthirsty man who arrived in power on the wave of a revolution and he turned into a dictator and tyrant. And monuments to him are still scattered all across Great Britain. Napoleon is deified. What did he do? He used the surge of evolutionary zeal and arrived in power. And he not just restored the monarchy, he pronounced himself Emperor. And he led France to a national catastrophe, to utter defeat. There are many situations, many people like that, more than enough in the world history. I think that excessive demoninisation of Stalin is one of the ways to attach the Soviet Union and Russia, to show that the Russia today has something originating from Stalinism. Well, of course we all have these birthmarks. What I am saying is that Russia has changed radically. Of course, something probably has remained in our mentality. However this does not mean that we should forget all the atrocities committed under Stalinism, the destruction of millions of our compatriots, the extermination camps. These things are not to be forgotten.**."*
        - *"...**What is oligarchy? It is the integration of money and power with a view to influence the decisions that are being taken and the final aim being the accumulation of wealth. My task was to differentiate between power and money. In 2008, i said many private enterpreneurs with whom i had not been acquainted with before, to my surprise they showed great qualities. They assumed great responsibility for the state of our enterprises, for keeping their employees, they were even willing to risk their capital....I am hopeful that, in compliance with the legislation, we are going to continue to develop our private businesses. But as of now, the issue of oligarchs and power is not as acute as it used to be in 1990s. We have a greater task now. We have to address the economic gap between the rich and those people with low level income...So as for the oligarchs, I do not see it as a problem anymore.**."*
        - *"...**You have an opinion of your own, you have a talent, you have a chance to show this talent, and you have a chance to leave a great legacy behind. Money doesn't bring this kind of happiness.**."*
        - *"...**The leaders of the former Soviet Union were also checked out and the system still collapsed. So the question is not about selection. The question you have asked whether Russia needs anyone that bad - Russia itself will decide. An alteration in power certainly has to exist. Indubitable, there needs to be a healty competition in thse processes, but this competition should be among people who have in mind the interest of the nation. In the end, let me iterate - the citizens of Russia are going to make the final decision.**."*
        - *"...**Do you think our goal is to prove anything to anyone? Our goal is to reinforce our country. We are not talking about survival, and we are not trying to justify ourselves. Certainly taking into account all negative tendencies you've been talking about - the Soviet legacy, it's something in the past. But we also have to think about the positive legacy. Russia has been built for 1000 years; it has its own traditions. We have our notions of what is just and unjust, we have our own understanding of what defines an efficient government...**."*
