You see the very core of the Russian Federation the Moscow region is simply indefensible. There are no mountains ranges, no rivers or oceans there are no swamps or deserts, only the Moscow forests and the inhospitable climate can be described as a geographic obstacle. The only thing the Russians can do in event of an invasion is drag out the war and bleed the enemy out. It is for this reason that Russia's history is largely about surviving invasion after invasion. Thes centuries long experience left the deep mark in the Russian culture and psychology and due to these experiences, the Russian leadership became obsessed with security and survival."

Yeltsin proposed a new Russian constitution which was popularly approved at the 1993 constitutional referendum. However, due to the sudden total economic shift, a majority of the national property and wealth fell into the hands of a small number of oligarchs. Rather than creating new enterprises, Yeltsin's policies led to international monopolies hijacking the former Soviet markets, arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market.* - [The Legacy of Boris Yeltsin, *the reality remains that few Russians will mourn Yeltsin’s departure. For the Russia which he wanted to created was not born. And his legacy, although important, has created the problems which the world faces with Russia today. Yeltsin was a great man, who also left a great deal of problems...Yeltsin is now accused by many ordinary Russians – including the current leaders in Moscow - for “giving up” on the Soviet Union, without getting anything in return from the West. The accusation is grotesque. By the time he became leader, the Soviet Union disintegrating; he was in no position to bargain, or extract any concessions. Gorbachev “lost” Eastern Europe; Yeltsin merely accepted that the Soviet Union was “lost” as well. The only way Yeltsin could have kept the empire together was by using military force. Wisely, Yeltsin never even considered that option, although it is doubtful that the Soviet armed forces would have been able to keep the country together, even if they were ordered to. Either way, for the first time in world history, an empire disappeared within weeks, without firing a shot...most of Yeltsin’s other activities had turned out to be big failures, and this was evident while he was still in government. The Russian leader granted his people a large degree of freedom: media and cultural activities exploded, and people suddenly felt liberated. But there was no attempt to create a coherent civil society, and no effort to portray Russia as a new liberating experience, after the horrible years of the Soviet Union...No leader can work miracles, single-handedly. But Yeltsin did not even try very hard. More importantly, the country’s resources were distributed – in a “spontaneous privatization” among a handful of people; that is how Russia’s so-called “oligarchs” were created..*](https://www.rusi.org/publication/legacy-boris-yeltsin)

During his six years in power, Gorbachev introduced at least 10 programs for the “radical restructuring” of the Soviet economy, not a one of which was implemented. Instead, economic reform was limited to inconsistent and incoherent half-measures...One of the most important insights in modern political economy is the potential conflict between good economics and good politics. In democratic regimes, where politicians depend on votes and campaign contributions to remain in office, research has shown that the logic of politics produces a shortsightedness with regard to economic policy. Popular economic policies are those that tend to yield short-term and easily identifiable benefits at the expense of long-term and largely hidden costs...If market reforms had been introduced sincerely by Gorbachev, the short-term prospects would have been higher prices as consumer subsidies were eliminated, unemployment as inefficient state enterprises were shut down, and overt income inequality as new entrepreneurs took advantage of opportunities for economic profit. In other words, structural economic reform promised short-term and easily identifiable costs to be borne mainly by the party bureaucracy, and long-term and largely hidden benefits in terms of increased economic efficiency and consumer well-being. The logic of reform was in direct conflict with the logic of politics, and politics won out...Glasnost, in addition to the events of 1989—from Tiananmen Square to the Berlin Wall—mobilized the intellectual and cultural elite.*"](https://fee.org/articles/why-perestroika-failed/) - ["*While it took several years for the economic and political reforms of perestroika to take effect, the new transparency under glasnost happened almost immediately. Shocking revelations about past abuses under the Soviet system came to light...There is little doubt that these reforms, intended to strengthen the economy and transform the political system, instead undermined the foundation of the Soviet Union...It could have ended with an explosion, and with blood, like the Yugoslav model where the thing fell apart, and the various pieces, republics, began warring with each other. Gorbachev managed, or is responsible for, the relatively peaceful end of an empire...Gorbachev wanted something like the Marshall Plan, and Bush refused to give it. Bush might have worried that the aid would go down the drain. But at the end, when Gorbachev desperately needed economic assistance in a big way, Bush wouldn’t provide it. That decision had consequences that linger today. Taubman believes that this period marked the only time in the last century that America had a Russian or Soviet partner that was truly willing to be an ally, making it a missed opportunity of huge proportions.*"](https://www.history.com/news/did-perestroika-cause-the-fall-of-the-soviet-union)

Wages were growing faster than the output of consumer goods and foodstuffs. This factor was creating a chronic shortage of goods...By mid-1991, no funds had been left in the Soviet government’s budget to subsidize state prices...the Gaidar team decided that the country might be confronted with a hunger without the immediate price liberalization...On December 3, 1991, Yeltsin signed a decree on price liberalization. The decree set free the wholesale and retail prices of most goods and services, except for a small group of socially essential items (sugar, salt, some types of bread, gasoline, vodka, milk and others)...Retail price regulation was finally terminated in Russia in 1995 after exemptions from Yeltsin’s price liberalization decree were cancelled...Gaidar and other liberal economists assessed positively as a whole the decision to switch to market prices. In their opinion, this measure helped save the country from hunger and even prevent a civil war. They considered high inflation and a plunge in household incomes as something inevitable.*](https://tass.com/economy/916534) - [Four Reformers in Russia’s Shock Therapy](https://geohistory.today/russia-shock-therapy/)

This was one of the motivations that  Putin had for the Russo-Ukrainian War. If Russia exacerbates tensions between Kyiv and Luhansk and Donetsk, NATO will be unwilling to make Ukraine a full partner. Indeed, the current war is history repeating itself. 14 years earlier, Georgia was  getting close to joining NATO. That required settling issues  with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But Russia made this impossible by invading. And thus there is no Georgia in NATO today."* / *"Cyprus is out as well. This, oddly enough, involves another NATO member. In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus. The war lasted a month until some lines were drawn on maps. Since then, Cyprus has been de facto split into regular Cyprus and Northern Cyprus. That alone would be a problem. But to make matters worse, Turkish forces  have aided Northern Cyprus since that time, which adds an extra layer of complication  because of Turkey’s veto power."*

This is not necessarily a trend that is exclusive to Turkey since far-right politicians often polarized their own societies for political gains. But taken together, Turkey is a geopolitical paradox while the Marmara heartland is wealthy, innovative and extrovert; Anatolia by comparison remains underprivileged, conservative and introvert; both regions compete and cooperate with one another and this internal contradiction sits at the heart of the geopolitical mindset of Turkey."
