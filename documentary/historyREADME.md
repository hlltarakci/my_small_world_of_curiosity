You see the very core of the Russian Federation the Moscow region is simply indefensible. There are no mountains ranges, no rivers or oceans there are no swamps or deserts, only the Moscow forests and the inhospitable climate can be described as a geographic obstacle. The only thing the Russians can do in event of an invasion is drag out the war and bleed the enemy out. It is for this reason that Russia's history is largely about surviving invasion after invasion. Thes centuries long experience left the deep mark in the Russian culture and psychology and due to these experiences, the Russian leadership became obsessed with security and survival."

- [x] [**Understanding the Turkish mindset**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg-TJO5yv2Q) - "In this context, Erdogan is the most consequential leader in Turkey second only to Ataturk by exploiting the polarized political arena, he has profoundly altered the prospects of the nation. This is not necessarily a trend that is exclusive to Turkey since far-right politicians often polarized their own societies for political gains. But taken together, Turkey is a geopolitical paradox while the Marmara heartland is wealthy, innovative and extrovert; Anatolia by comparison remains underprivileged, conservative and introvert; both regions compete and cooperate with one another and this internal contradiction sits at the heart of the geopolitical mindset of Turkey."
