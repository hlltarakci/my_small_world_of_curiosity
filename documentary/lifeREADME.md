It's taken since 56 years and probably you have never watched before.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r2ZJhJ8zCE) - *"Each people that were shown us, every 7 year, become a new people. We watch their life in 9 different episode as 9 different people. If we find ourselves at low points of their lives, we understand that it would not always be like that. You may become a very different person in 7 years. And of course, we may find ourselves at peak points of their lives. Then we understand that the excellent, beautiful and bright situation which we were in would not always be like that. You may lose everything you have in 7 years. While we are living life we shouldn't forget that: The point which we have reached, is not a point actually. It seems us like that. After 7 years, we will be changed with all our cells. Converting the end to a comma is in our hands. Continuing writing good things on a clean page instead of scribbling the page when we were 7 is in our hands.*

- [x] [SERIES][**Deep Time History, Curiosity Stream**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6052190/) - quite similar in context to Harari's Sapiens. Linking ideas, providing a general structure why things happened the way they did fascinates me. And this is a transferable thought experiment skill.
