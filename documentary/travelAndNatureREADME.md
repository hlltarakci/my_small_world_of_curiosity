And in accordance with these trends, in accordance with the change and changing world, it is necessary of course, to adapt international organisations accordingly...But to close them down or leave them - it seems to me that there is no point in this**......Because the Russian language is both the soul and founcation of Russian culture....But since then, the struggle between Westernism and nationalists, and so on, began in Russia...**We often slide into an extreme unfortunately. We always lack pragmatism. We should not be ashamed to take all the best that is available anywhere..At the same time, we must never forget our roots, we must rely on tradition, and thus, acting pragmatically, achieve the maximum result for ourselves.**.."*

It also reflects their ability to comprehend, accept and develop all the best things rather than underscore the differences, to find commonality, rise to the height of mutual spiritual enrichment and go forward together. These principals have been close to Russia and our people throughout our history. A country-civilisation, Russia has carefully kept the languages and traditions of all peoples living in it and is a unique unity of a multitude of distinctive cultures. The experience of the millenium-old history of our country convincingly shows that cultural diversity is the greatest blessing while the interaction of cultures is one of the conditions for stable and peaceful development. ...only culture can ensure the safety and reasonability of innovation. Culture is the most ethical regulator of technological progress...**."*
