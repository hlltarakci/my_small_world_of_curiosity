That is, the physical universe is not merely described by mathematics, but is mathematics — specifically, a mathematical structure. Mathematical existence equals physical existence, and all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well. Observers, including humans, are *self-aware substructures (SASs)*. In any mathematical structure complex enough to contain such substructures, they *will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically real world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis)
