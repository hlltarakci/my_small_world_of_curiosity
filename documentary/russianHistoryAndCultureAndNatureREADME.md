Russian TV Series**](https://youtu.be/3m3dgtI7P74?si=Cz-FFWw7IS5_kiz6) - *"Vladimir had the traders spreading the news across the adjoining lands that the Prince of Kiev was ready to abolish paganism. Now he was awaiting emissaries from each power to try and covert him into their faith. Vladimir was not in a hurry. He knew that his choice would influence the fate of his country. First, the Bulgars of Muhammad faith came. They said: “You are wise and clever but you don’t know the law. Believe in our law and kneel before Muhammad.” Vladimir listened attentively to imams from the Volga Bulgaria. He questioned them about the Sharia law. Both the court and Vladimir knew that belief in Allah was the faith of the winners. The Prince liked the simplicity of the Muslim faith but he didn’t like the ban on pork and wine. The imams were stupefied by the frivolity of the Prince. It was only an excuse. The great khagan of all the Slavs just didn’t want someone else’s faith, so different in culture and customs, so unlike the life of his people. Violent and passionate faith of the Muslims born in the hot Arabian sands was unsuitable for the forest lands of Rus....Then the Germans came from Rome; they claimed that they came as emissaries of the Pope. “For our faith is the light. We worship God, who has made heaven and earth, the stars, the moon, and every breathing creature.” Vladimir was cautious when he heard that the Pope was supposed to be the mediator between him and God. He wouldn’t accept someone else’s interfering in the earthly affairs. However, he wanted to understand the essence of the Christian faith. So, Vladimir straight away inquired what their teaching was. Missionaries heard about the unsuccessful Muslims. So, they offered what was most attractive to him from their point of view: "Fast according to your strength. Whatever one eats or drinks is all to the glory of God, as our teacher Paul has said." Vladimir was disappointed. And he refused them without giving a reason. Vladimir answered: "Go on your way; our fathers don’t accept such principles". Thus, he politely hinted on how his father Svyatoslav drove the embassy of Pope away from Kiev....The Jewish Khazars heard of those missions, and came too saying: "We have learned that Bulgars and Christians came hither to tell you about their faiths. The Christians believe in him whom we crucified, but we believe in the one God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.'' Arrogance of the wise Rabbis made Vladimir quiver. He knew something about the fate of the Jewish people. So, he asked the most painful question: "Where is your native land?" The Jews replied that it was in Jerusalem. Vladimir pressed on ruthlessly: "Are you sure it’s there?" Rabbis had to painfully admit that the Jews had no land. "God got angry with our forefathers, and scattered us around the world." "How can you teach others if you yourselves are cast out and scattered abroad by the hand of God? Do you expect us to accept that fate too?" Kiev Prince was not interested in the peculiarities of the oldest religion or the relationship of God with his people. Israel died under the Roman heel. Rus conquered the Jewish Khazaria. The Jewish belief belonged in the past. Vladimir wanted the religion of the future.....Then the Greeks sent a philosopher to Vladimir who spoke thus: "If you desire to hear the story, I shall tell you from the beginning why God descended to the Earth." The Byzantine philosopher didn’t speak of the rituals and law. Instead he unravelled for the Prince of Kiev an incredible prophecy about the coming of Christ, the son of God. He recited the Gospel as if he was there with Jesus himself. Listening to the philosopher, Vladimir began to understand a little about the Christians. But the most important thing remained uncomprehensive. How was that possible? God was all mighty and infinite. How could he be so weak to let himself be executed and suffer a long and shameful death? Could he really die? The Greek responded: “God is almighty.“ It was quiet in the hall. Vladimir kept silent for a long time. He was thinking hard and painfully. Finally, he told the philosopher that he put all his words in his heart....**The main argument in favor of the new faith was the Prince himself – reborn and changed after the baptism. He accepted his new faith genuinely and warmly, and he didn’t separate his personal destiny from that of his nation. He baptized himself and he baptized Rus.**.."* - [Анна Византийская](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Porphyrogenita) - [Anna Porphyrogenita – the wife and companion of Volodymyr the Great](https://st-sophia.org.ua/en/news/anna-porphyrogenita-the-wife-and-companion-of-volodymyr-the-great-frescoes-of-sophia-testify/)

It will withstand an invasion that destroyed many other states. It will outlive mighty empires. Spreading across the continent, it will become the largest country in the world.

This meant international recognition of the Russian state. As a sign of this, [Олег](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_the_Wise) ordered his war shield to be nailed above the gates of Tsargrad.

The arbitrary [полюдье](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliudie) with its ruinous feasts and extortion was replaced by a clear system of taxation. All the lands from Kiev to Novgorod were divided into districts, each with a princely administrator from among the worthy senior warriors, who answered only to the princess and was responsible for everything that happened in his district. From this moment until the death of Princess Ольга, there is not a single mention of a rebellion by any of the tribes subject to Kiev.**."*
     - *"...**Ольга needed a universal powerful tool to strengthen her state. Where else to look for it but in Byzantium - a vast empire that had united different peoples for many centuries?...And it was then that the princess found what she was looking for. The power of Byzantium rested on the Christian faith....Princess Ольга was the first of the Russian rulers to adopt Christianity. And she will be the first to be glorified as equal to the apostles, honored by both the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church...the remains of his grandmother, Princess Ольга, to be moved to the new church. When the coffin was opened, the princess's body was found incorrupt. She seemed to be sleeping. This was the first instance of incorrupt relics in Russian history.**.."*
     - *"...**The official glorification of Владимир the Baptizer in the rank of equal-to-the-apostles saints would occur only two centuries later, but in the popular consciousness, he began to be revered as a saint soon after the end of his earthly life. He did everything with grandeur and power. It was he who turned the fragmented lands, inhabited by various tribes and peoples, into a single state under the rule of the princely Rurik dynasty. It was he who gave his country what would hold it together for a millennium, holding it firmly and unbreakably, - the Orthodox faith.**."*
     - [Ярослав](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslav_the_Wise)
     - *"...**And his agreement with the Novgorodians would become the first article of the first legal code in Russian history, which would later be named after its creator - "Ярослав's Justice ([Русская Правда](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russkaya_Pravda))". "Ярослав's Justice" - a collection of laws, analogous to early medieval European legal codes. It contained 18 articles defining punishments for murder, assault, property damage, and other crimes, limiting blood vengeance for murder to the closest relatives, establishing a fine, known as vira, for murder. Together with later additions, it formed the "Русская Правда" - a legal code that was in effect in Rus' until the 15th century.**."*
     - *"...**The main role of a woman in ancient Russian society was managing the household. In noble families, the lady of the house not only raised children and supervised the servants, but also managed vast properties, including financial assets. Girls from noble families received excellent education, were fluent in several languages. Non-noble women often had professions such as healer, midwife, weaver, seamstress, cook, matchmaker. "Русская Правда" prescribed the same punishment for killing a woman as for killing a man. Women had the right to testify in court, and in rare cases, could participate in public and political life.**."*

The veneration of the prince as a saintly and pious figure began immediately after his death. The official church-wide glorification was established in 2016. He made mistakes and suffered defeats, but he knew how to correct errors, repay debts, and persistently strive for victories. Having survived a severe civil war, he did everything to prevent the division of the country. Under him, Kievan Rus achieved genuine prosperity. To the two functions of a prince (warrior and keeper of the law) he added a third, no less important one - educator, and entered history as Ярослав the Wise.**"*

They brought many personal items, jewelry, including gifts and books. On the way, the princess learned the language and customs of her new country. After delivering the bride to the groom, the guard returned, but the entourage stayed with her.**."*
     - *"...**The order of succession was determined by the so-called ladder law - from the word "ladder", which meant the transfer of the Kiev throne from father to eldest son, and then from brother to brother in order of seniority. The other princes occupied their thrones sequentially, moving after the elder brother. Allocating domains among sons could only be done by the prince of Kiev. And those princes whose father did not manage to occupy the Kiev throne, fell out of the system and were left without domains becoming outcasts.**."*
     - *"...**The Polovtsians (or Kipchaks) - a key Turkic-speaking people...The main
strength of the Polovtsian army was light cavalry. The Polovtsians couldn't take fortresses and preferred to go on raiding expeditions. They ravaged small towns and villages on the border with the steppe, taking thousands of people captive. The exhausting war with the Polovtsians lasted a century and a half and nearly brought down the Russian state.**."*
     - *"...**Disaster came from where it was least expected. Across Western Europe - in Italy, France, Germany - an epidemic was raging, called St. Anthony's Fire....Those affected by St. Anthony's Fire seemed to burn alive, dying in terrible agony...The plague reached the Russian lands....In ancient Rus, there were several forms of medical care: private practice, guardianship, and hospital care.**."*
     - *"...**Мономах understood that this could not continue. For years the country had been at war. While the princes were dividing thrones, the Polovtsians were ravaging their lands, burning towns and villages. And there was no one left to restore them. Thousands of Russian captives were being sold in slave markets from Byzantium to Khwarezm. The feud had to be stopped. At any cost. And Мономах, with titanic effort, convened the first all-Russian congress of princes in Lyubech - to establish peace. The Lyubech Congress decided: each prince should hold his patrimony. Thus, the ladder principle of succession by seniority was replaced by the hereditary principle. The initiator of this was Мономах, despite the fact that this principle was the least advantageous for him. They said to each other: "From now on, let us unite with one heart and protect the Russian land." And on that they kissed the cross.**."*
     - *"...**He would work on this piece until the end of his life. It would become his will and would be called "The Instruction of Владимир Мономах." This work would become an ethical program for many generations of Russian princes. "My children, do not forget the poor. Give to the orphan. Neither the right, nor the guilty kill. If one is guilty of death, do not destroy any Christian soul. Honor the old as a father, and the young as brothers. In your home do not be lazy. But watch over everything yourself. Beware of lies, drunkenness, and debauchery. For the soul and body perish from these. Love your wife, but do not give her power over you. And here is the foundation of all - have the fear of God above all.'**."*
     - *"...**It was said that all the neighboring rulers were terrified....And the Greek emperor even sent Мономах rich gifts, so he would not march on Constantinople. From these stories, many centuries later, the legend would arise of Мономах's gifts, that Emperor Constantine allegedly gave Prince Vladimircoronation regalia - a golden crown, a belt, and a necklace. In the 16th century, the crown of Russian tsars would be named the "[шапка Мономаха](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomakh%27s_Cap)." -апка Мономаха, displayed in the Armory Chamber of the Moscow Kremlin, is the oldest of the royal regalia, a symbol of Russian autocracy. It was used to crown Russian tsars from Ivan the Terrible to Ivan V, the brother and co-ruler of Peter the Great. But this crown has no connection to Владимир Мономах.**."*
     - *"...**The next day in Kiev, a revolt against the usurers broke out. Since Christianity prohibited usury, that is lending money at interest, usury was primarily conducted by Jews. The main reason for the first Jewish pogrom in Russian history was not the usurers' religion, but the incredibly high, ruinous interest rates they charged for their financial operations...In Kiev, a new financial order was established - the Charter of Владимир Мономах, which would later become part of "[Русская Правда](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russkaya_Pravda)"**."*
     - *"...**Under him and possibly at his initiative, a new edition of the chronicle "Повесть временных лет ([The Tale of Bygone Years / Primary Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Chronicle))" was created. Chronicle writing in Rus began as early as the 11th century. It was carried out by learned monks. In the early 12th century, a monk of the Kiev-Pechersk Monastery, Nestor, compiled the oldest chronicles, added descriptions of recent years, and created an extensive chronicle known today as "Повесть временных лет" - the main document on the history of the Old Russian state, the Rurik dynasty, and the spread of Christianity in Rus.**."*
     - *"...**In almost all major ancient Russian cities, the highest ruling body was the вече. The [вече](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veche) decided on major governance issues, declared war and made peace, established and abolished taxes and duties, managed the city's land resources and finances, as well as the princely throne. By вече decision, the city could reject a new prince or expel an old one, if he failed in his duties.**."*
     - *"...**At the beginning of the 12th century, the Ancient Russian state was a union of principalities subordinate to Kiev. They all paid annual tribute and church tithes to the capital. The Grand Prince of Kiev had the right to appoint junior princes to thrones and transfer them from one principality to another at his discretion. He held unquestioned authority and was the guarantor of stability. Kiev remained an all-Russian trade crossroads, where enormous wealth flowed. Possessing Kiev was a coveted goal for many princes.**."*
     - *"...**The prince, surveying both sides of the Moscow River, fell in love with these lands and ordered a small wooden town to be built there, named after the river - the town of Moscow. The villages of Stepan Kuchka are now districts of Moscow. The village of Kuchkovo, the center of the boyar's estate, was located on the site of today's Lubyanka. On Borovitsky Hill, where the Kremlin stands today, [Юрий Долгорукий](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Dolgorukiy) ordered the construction of a wooden fortress. The structure with walls about 1,200 meters long occupied the triangle between

Created in the 12th century in Constantinople as a copy of the Jerusalem icon, painted, according to church tradition, by the evangelist Luke during the life of the Mother of God. In the late 14th century, to protect against the invasion of Tamerlane, the Vladimir Icon was moved to Moscow. Tamerlane inexplicably halted his campaign and withdrew. Where the meeting, or "sreténie," of the icon took place, the Sretensky Monastery was founded, and later Sretenka Street. According to legend, the Vladimir Icon saved Moscow twice more from Tatar invasions. Today it resides in the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi at the Tretyakov Gallery. It is venerated as the protector of all Russian lands.**."*
     - *"...**According to chronicles, the city of Vladimir on the Klyazma was founded in 990 by Vladimir the Baptizer. However, archaeological evidence points to 1108. The founder - Владимир Мономах. [Андрей Боголюбский](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Bogolyubsky) almost tripled Monomakh's city. The city was entered through seven stone gates. The main ones - the monumental Golden - and Silver Gates were connected by a central street. Under Prince Андрей, 30 churches were built in Vladimir and its surroundings. Most of them - wooden. The grand Assumption Cathedral was built from white stone. Its height surpassed both St. Sophia in Kiev and St. Sophia in Novgorod. In the early 15th century, its walls would be decorated with frescoes by the great icon painters Andrei Rublev and Daniil Cherny. In the late 15th century, it would serve as a model for the Assumption Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin.**."*
     - *"...**Андрей never appeared in Kiev. He placed his brother in the capital, and having received the title of Grand Prince, stayed in Vladimir. This was a turning point in Russian political history. From now on, the title of Grand Prince was separated from the Kiev throne. Thus, almost half of Rus' came under the control of the Grand Prince of Vladimir.**."*
     - *"...**500 years later, he would be canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. And July 4th would become the day of remembrance for Saint Blessed Prince Андрей Боголюбский. His father, Юрий Долгорукий, clung to the past. Prince Андрей strived towards the future so fast that he surpassed his time. He built temples that would become the standard of Russian architecture for centuries. And he built a political system that the country would come to only after centuries. As once on the battlefield, he went too far from his contemporaries, from his era, unprepared to accept his autocracy. And he paid for it with his life.**."*

The Orthodox included the Balkan states, several regions in Asia Minor, and Rus'. Almost all of the rest of Europe was at that time under the control of the Catholic church. It was the peak of the era of the Crusades - religious wars by Western Christians against Muslims of the Middle East. And later against other infidels, including in Eastern Europe. The Catholic church pursued an aggressive policy of land seizure and forced conversion of the pagans of the Baltic to Catholicism.

It has now been proven that the battle was not on the ice. Mid-spring in the 12th century was much warmer than now, even in northern Europe. At the time of the battle, the lake could not have had ice strong enough to hold hundreds of heavily armed cavalrymen. The scale of the battle was also greatly exaggerated.**."*

     - *"...**The title "Genghis Khan" was received in 1206 by the tribal leader Temujin, who managed to unite many nomadic Mongol tribes into a single state. In the struggle for power, Temujin completely exterminated the Tatar tribe. But it was the Mongol invaders who would be called Tatars in China, Rus', and Europe. As a result of the conquests of Genghis Khan and his successors, by the mid-13th century, the Mongol Empire occupied the largest contiguous territory in world history.**."*
     - *"...**The Mongol yoke - political dependency of Russian princes on the Horde...By confirming their rights to their own lands, Russian princes became not only vassals but also tribute-payers to the Khan. The yoke lasted for more than 240 years. During this time, about 2000 words of Turkic origin entered the Russian language through the Horde.**."*

     - *"...**In Novgorod, [Александр Ярославич Невский](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky) was awaited by envoys from the Pope. They offered him an alliance against the Mongols in exchange for accepting the Catholic doctrine. The split of the united apostolic Church of Christ into the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox, called the "Great Schism," occurred in 1054. But the division of the churches began long before that. Rome and Constantinople first parted ways for political reasons, but over the centuries, things became much more complicated. While professing the same Christian faith, Catholics and Orthodox differ in matters of theology, worship practices, church politics, and culture. To the papal envoys, Александр replied: "From Adam to the flood, from the flood to the division of languages, from the mixing of languages to Christ's birth, from Christ's birth to the suffering and resurrection of the Lord, from his resurrection to the ascension to heaven, from the ascension to heaven to the first council, from the first council to the seventh....We know all this well, but we do not accept your teachings." The cardinals did not expect such a response. In their opinion, Prince Александр was not in a position to refuse the protection of the Pope and Western assistance. But Александр Ярославич knew exactly what he was doing. No political considerations could make the prince sacrifice the salvation of his soul and the faith of his people. After the trip to Karakorum, everything became crystal clear to him. The Mongols - that very people from the ends of the earth, as the biblical prophets spoke of. Against them, military skill and strategy are useless. This is a force of nature that cannot be resisted, with Western help or without. The Catholics changed everything in their lands: state, language, culture, doctrine. The Horde, however, imposed no customs and forced no one into their faith. Not everyone understood this.**."*
     - *"...**Prince Александр ЯНевский was glorified as a saint of the blessed in the mid-16th century. But the veneration of the holy prince began immediately after his death. According to church tradition, the incorrupt relics of Prince Александр were miraculously found on the eve of the Battle of Kulikovo. In 1723, by order of Peter I, the relics of the holy prince were moved from Vladimir to Petersburg, to the newly established AАлександр Невский Lavra, which gave its name to the main street of the empire - Невский проспект. From that time on, the veneration of Александр Невский took on a state character. Three Russian emperors were named Александр in his honor. In Soviet times, in 1942, the Order of Prince Александр Невский was the first pre-revolutionary order to be restored. Today it is the only order that unites the award systems of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union,
and the Russian Federation.**."*
     - *"...**By humbling his pride, he acknowledged dependence on the Horde and thus saved his country from total destruction. With his choice, Александр Ярославич predetermined the future course of Russian history. His military exploits in the West against the Order, and his feat of humility in the East with the Horde had one goal: the preservation of the Russian Orthodox state.**."*

You see the very core of the Russian Federation the Moscow region is simply indefensible. There are no mountains ranges, no rivers or oceans there are no swamps or deserts, only the Moscow forests and the inhospitable climate can be described as a geographic obstacle. The only thing the Russians can do in event of an invasion is drag out the war and bleed the enemy out. It is for this reason that Russia's history is largely about surviving invasion after invasion. Thes centuries long experience left the deep mark in the Russian culture and psychology and due to these experiences, the Russian leadership became obsessed with security and survival."*

- [x] [Boris Yeltsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VqLWtJEJs) - *Yeltsin transformed Russia's socialist economy into a capitalist market economy, implementing economic shock therapy, market exchange rate of the ruble, nationwide privatization and lifting of price controls. Yeltsin proposed a new Russian constitution which was popularly approved at the 1993 constitutional referendum. However, due to the sudden total economic shift, a majority of the national property and wealth fell into the hands of a small number of oligarchs. Rather than creating new enterprises, Yeltsin's policies led to international monopolies hijacking the former Soviet markets, arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market.* - [The Legacy of Boris Yeltsin, *the reality remains that few Russians will mourn Yeltsin’s departure. For the Russia which he wanted to created was not born. And his legacy, although important, has created the problems which the world faces with Russia today. Yeltsin was a great man, who also left a great deal of problems...Yeltsin is now accused by many ordinary Russians – including the current leaders in Moscow - for “giving up” on the Soviet Union, without getting anything in return from the West. The accusation is grotesque. By the time he became leader, the Soviet Union disintegrating; he was in no position to bargain, or extract any concessions. Gorbachev “lost” Eastern Europe; Yeltsin merely accepted that the Soviet Union was “lost” as well. The only way Yeltsin could have kept the empire together was by using military force. Wisely, Yeltsin never even considered that option, although it is doubtful that the Soviet armed forces would have been able to keep the country together, even if they were ordered to. Either way, for the first time in world history, an empire disappeared within weeks, without firing a shot...most of Yeltsin’s other activities had turned out to be big failures, and this was evident while he was still in government. The Russian leader granted his people a large degree of freedom: media and cultural activities exploded, and people suddenly felt liberated. But there was no attempt to create a coherent civil society, and no effort to portray Russia as a new liberating experience, after the horrible years of the Soviet Union...No leader can work miracles, single-handedly. But Yeltsin did not even try very hard. More importantly, the country’s resources were distributed – in a “spontaneous privatization” among a handful of people; that is how Russia’s so-called “oligarchs” were created..*](https://www.rusi.org/publication/legacy-boris-yeltsin)

During his six years in power, Gorbachev introduced at least 10 programs for the “radical restructuring” of the Soviet economy, not a one of which was implemented. Instead, economic reform was limited to inconsistent and incoherent half-measures...One of the most important insights in modern political economy is the potential conflict between good economics and good politics. In democratic regimes, where politicians depend on votes and campaign contributions to remain in office, research has shown that the logic of politics produces a shortsightedness with regard to economic policy. Popular economic policies are those that tend to yield short-term and easily identifiable benefits at the expense of long-term and largely hidden costs...If market reforms had been introduced sincerely by Gorbachev, the short-term prospects would have been higher prices as consumer subsidies were eliminated, unemployment as inefficient state enterprises were shut down, and overt income inequality as new entrepreneurs took advantage of opportunities for economic profit. In other words, structural economic reform promised short-term and easily identifiable costs to be borne mainly by the party bureaucracy, and long-term and largely hidden benefits in terms of increased economic efficiency and consumer well-being. The logic of reform was in direct conflict with the logic of politics, and politics won out...Glasnost, in addition to the events of 1989—from Tiananmen Square to the Berlin Wall—mobilized the intellectual and cultural elite.*"](https://fee.org/articles/why-perestroika-failed/) - ["*While it took several years for the economic and political reforms of perestroika to take effect, the new transparency under glasnost happened almost immediately. Shocking revelations about past abuses under the Soviet system came to light...There is little doubt that these reforms, intended to strengthen the economy and transform the political system, instead undermined the foundation of the Soviet Union...It could have ended with an explosion, and with blood, like the Yugoslav model where the thing fell apart, and the various pieces, republics, began warring with each other. Gorbachev managed, or is responsible for, the relatively peaceful end of an empire...Gorbachev wanted something like the Marshall Plan, and Bush refused to give it. Bush might have worried that the aid would go down the drain. But at the end, when Gorbachev desperately needed economic assistance in a big way, Bush wouldn’t provide it. That decision had consequences that linger today. Taubman believes that this period marked the only time in the last century that America had a Russian or Soviet partner that was truly willing to be an ally, making it a missed opportunity of huge proportions.*"](https://www.history.com/news/did-perestroika-cause-the-fall-of-the-soviet-union)

Wages were growing faster than the output of consumer goods and foodstuffs. This factor was creating a chronic shortage of goods...By mid-1991, no funds had been left in the Soviet government’s budget to subsidize state prices...the Gaidar team decided that the country might be confronted with a hunger without the immediate price liberalization...On December 3, 1991, Yeltsin signed a decree on price liberalization. The decree set free the wholesale and retail prices of most goods and services, except for a small group of socially essential items (sugar, salt, some types of bread, gasoline, vodka, milk and others)...Retail price regulation was finally terminated in Russia in 1995 after exemptions from Yeltsin’s price liberalization decree were cancelled...Gaidar and other liberal economists assessed positively as a whole the decision to switch to market prices. In their opinion, this measure helped save the country from hunger and even prevent a civil war. They considered high inflation and a plunge in household incomes as something inevitable.*](https://tass.com/economy/916534) - [Four Reformers in Russia’s Shock Therapy](https://geohistory.today/russia-shock-therapy/)

This was one of the motivations that  Putin had for the Russo-Ukrainian War. If Russia exacerbates tensions between Kyiv and Luhansk and Donetsk, NATO will be unwilling to make Ukraine a full partner. Indeed, the current war is history repeating itself. 14 years earlier, Georgia was  getting close to joining NATO. That required settling issues  with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But Russia made this impossible by invading. And thus there is no Georgia in NATO today."* / *"Cyprus is out as well. This, oddly enough, involves another NATO member. In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus. The war lasted a month until some lines were drawn on maps. Since then, Cyprus has been de facto split into regular Cyprus and Northern Cyprus. That alone would be a problem. But to make matters worse, Turkish forces  have aided Northern Cyprus since that time, which adds an extra layer of complication  because of Turkey’s veto power."*

        - *"..**You know, it was quite understandable to Gorbachev and his entourage that the country needed changes.Today, i can say with all confidence they didn't understand what changes were necessary and how to achieve them. ..This is not Gorbachev's idea. This idea of utopia was put forward by the French socialists, so Gorbachev has nothing to do with this. I reiterate Gorbachev's merit is that he felt the need for change. That's true. And he tried to change the system. But the problem is this system was not efficient in its roots. How could you radically change the situation and the system while preserving the country? That's something noone knew back then, including Gorbachev. And they pushed the country towards a collapse.**."*
        - *"..**I often hear criticism addressed to me that i regret the collapse of Soviet Union. First of all, most important thing is that after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, 25 million Russians found themselves abroad in one night. And that was one of the greatest catastrrophies of the 20th century. People used to live in one country. In a blink of the eye they found themselves abroad.**.."*
        - *"..**You know, i don't think i have the right to give any assessment to Gorbachev or the peronality of Yeltsin. Just like any of us, he had his problems, but he also had his strengths. And one of them is that he never avoided personal responsibility. He knew how to assume responsibility.**...I don't know why Yeltsin chose me. But when Yeltsin offered me the job first time, i refused...**And to assume responsibility for Russia back then was a very difficult thing to do.**.."*
        - *"...**I didn't stop the privatisation. I just wanted to make it more equitable, more fair. I did everything so that state property was not sold for free. We put an end to some schemes, which led to the creation of oligarchs. These schemes allowed some people to become billionaires in a flash. And it also led to a situation where the Government either lost control of strategic industries or just led to the destruction of the industries. So my goal was not to stop the privatisation, but to make it more sytemic, more equitable.**.."*
        - *"...Do you know what they say among the Russian people? **They say that those who are destined to be hanged are not going to drown.**.."*
        - *"...**But there is great difference between us. Ronald Reagan was the head of the United States. And be that as it may, his difficulties in the US, were not comparable to those we faced in Russia at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of 2000...Almost being broke and actually being broke are two entirely different things...Incidentally, Russia not only paid back its debt to IMF, we also paid back the debts of all the former Soviet Republics.**."*
        - *"...**When the decision was taken for the unification of Germany, and on the subsequent withdrawal of Soviet troops in Eastern Europe, the dignitaries in the United States and NATO secretary General, they were all saying that the one thing that Soviet Union could be sure of was that the Eastern border of NATO would not be extended any further than the Eastern border of the German Democratic Republic. It was a mistake made by Mr Gorbachev. In politics, everything must be enshrined in paper. He just talked, and he decided that was enough....NATO was set up during the period when there was a confrontation between two blocs, the Eastern and Western blocs. Now the Warsaw Treaty has faded away, there is no longer an Eastern bloc, no more Soviet Union. Therefore, why does NATO keep existing? My impression is that in order to justify its existence, NATO has a ned of an external foe, there is a constant search for the foe or some acts of provocation to name someone as an adversary.**.."*
        - *"...**The unipolar world that had been proposed after the Cold War did not take place either..However, what is a unipolar world? However, one might embelish this term, at the end of the day, it refers to one type of situation, namely one center of authority, one center of force, one center of decision making. It is a world in which there is one master, one severeign, and at the end of the day, this is pernicious not only for those within the system, but for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself within..One state and of course, first and foremost the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way. This is visible in the economic, political, cultural and educational policies it emposes on other nations..."*
        - *"..**Nowadays, NATO is a mere instrument of foreign policy of the US. It has no allies, it has only vassals. Once a country becomes a MATO member, it is hard to resist the pressures of the US. And allof a sudden anly weapon system can be placed in this country...And what are we supposed to do? In this case, we have to take countermeasures..The situation becomes more tense...Why are we so acutely responding to the expansion of NATO?..We are concerned by the practice of how decisions are taken....I said 'We would condier an option that Russia might join NATO.'. Clinton said 'Why not?'. But the US delegation got very nervous.**.."*
        - *"..**You see, our openness to all our partners, including towards the US, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and change in our political system was so great that it even covered our Nuclear forces. We had almost no secrets back then...I believe that if you think you are the only world power, trying to impose whole nation the idea of their exclusiveness, this creates an imperialistic mentality in society, which in turn requires an adequate foreign policy expected by society. And in practice this might go contrary to the interests of the Americans. That's the way i see it.Because in the end, it leads to problems and deficiencies. And it demonstrates it is impossible to control everything...After WW2, a bipolar world order emerged. I think it was a strategic mistake of the Soviet Union and quite frankly Soviet Union was at that time behaving quite primitively and they gave the US excuse to create NATO and to launch the Cold War. I think the US felt they were fore-front of the so-called civilised world and when the Soviet Union collapsed, they were under the illusion that they were capable of anything. That's always a trap. Because in this situation, the person or the country began to make mistakes. There is no need to analyse situations, or think about the consequences. And the country becomes inefficient. I think that's the trap the US has found itself in.**.."*

So what is the point in expanding NATO? Against who? In order to ensure the security of many countries, if they feel threatened, it is not necessary to expand NATO. You can conclude bilateral agreements on mutual assistance and security. There is no need to create an image of an adversary. There have been two expansion waves of NATO. After that, the US has inilaterally withdrawn from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (2001). And they are always saying to us that we should not be concerned by that, this is not a threat to Russia. Allegedly they did that to counter the threat of Iran. But right now the Iranian issue has gone. A treaty has been signed. Iran has renounced any military nuclear programs. The US has agreed to that. They said that they have signed the relevant document. But the anti-ballistic missile development program is underway in Europe-some of its elements are to be stationed there. Against whom are they doing this? And this requires a response from Russia.**."*

Russia is their motherland.....As to the inter-ethnic relations, this has always been a delicate issue - whenever, wherever. But Russia has certain advantages in this regard. For example, take Europe and US of today and you'll see that people with other religions are mostly immigrants. Russia is different. Those people with other religions are Russians. And it is their homeland and they have none other. From the very beginning, Russia was emerging as a multi-religious and multi-ethnic country. And over a thousand years, we've nurtured a certain culture of interaction. And those places where mixed poplulations live - Christians and Muslims - there are many situations when people side-by-side celebrate both Muslim feast days and Christian holidays. And i think that based on these huge positive experiences, we will be able to surmount quite easily all those things - sensitive delicate issues of inter-ethnic and inter-religious interactions.**."*

Stalin found himself at the helm of the state. Only at the beginning of the 1990s, events came to pass that lay the foundation of a new stage of the Russian development. Certainly it cannot be expected that we would instantenously have the same democratic model as in the US, Germany or France.

Certainly the people thought that moving in any way toward the EU would liberate them from the terrible conditions they had found themselves in starting from the 1990s. That was the driving force behind the developments in Ukraine...The economies of Russia and Ukraine were emerging as a united economy and had unique economic relations..The markets of Russia were absolutely open to imports from Ukraine**.."*
        - *"...**For 17 years we had been in negotiations with EU on the conditions of Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization and all of a sudden, it was announced to us that Ukraine and the EU were signing an association agreement. And that meant the opening up of the Ukrainian markets. The EU would be able to enter our territory with all of their goods without any negotiations, despite the agreements - principled agreements - which we had reached with them before, during those 17 year talks on our accession to the WTO. Certainly we had to respond to that, and we said that if Ukraine had decided to act like that, it was all their choice. But this didn't mean that we had to pay for this choice. Why do people living in Russia today have to pay for this choice the Ukrainian leadership has made? We proposed that we hold talks with our European partners in a trilateral format. But there was a flat refusal. They told us that we had better stay out of it.**.."*

The legitimate parliament of Crimea which was elected based on Ukrainian legislation announced a referandum. The Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, voted to join Russia. Yes, we created conditions for people to go to polling stations, but we did not engage any hostilities. No one was shooting and no one was killed. More than 90% of the Crimean population, turned out, they voted, and once the ballot was cast, the Parliament, based on the outcome of referandum, addressed the Russian parliament, asking it to incorporate it into the Russian Federation...Moreover, Ukraine lost the territory, not due to Russia's position, but due to the position assumed by those who are living in Crimea.**.."*

        - *"...**Right now a certain strengtening of American influence is being witnessed in Europe, partly due to the Eastern Europen countries, because they are trying to resist the former dominating power of the Soviet Union. Right now it's mirrored in Russia, but sooner or later this is going to stop...Through initiating the crisis in Ukraine, they've (the Americans) managed to stimulate such an attitude towards Russia, viewing Russia as an enemy, a possible potential aggressor....that there is no threat whatsoever emanating from Russia, either to the Baltic countries, or to Eastern Europe, or to Western Europe. And the stronger this misunderstanding is the greater the desire is going to be to protect their (European) sovereignity and to fend for their national interests...So this constant feeling of being under pressure, let me assure you, is something no one is happy about. Sooner or later this is going to have consequences if it's going to stop.**..."*
        - *"...**And it's better if this happens through dialogue....but i think what is needed right now is the transition to a new paradigm, a new philosophy for building relations among countries. And this paradigm should be based on respect for the interests of other countries, for the sovereignity of other people, not just trying to intimidate them using some outer threat which can only be resisted with the help of the US. This paradigm will have to cease to exist sooner or later**..."*
        - on Syria - *...**We are not interested in adding fuel to this conflict. Quite the contrary, we are interested in foxtering dialogue,so as to preserve the territorial integrity of this country which is very complicated matter. This is very difficult and it is not easy to find consensus.**.."* - [How Russia's Putin became the go-to man on Syria](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51733595) - [Operation Syria: Erdoğan’s Victory, Putin’s Triumph](https://www.resetdoc.org/story/operation-syria-erdogans-victory-putins-triumph/)

        - *"...**Since the early 1990s, we have assumed that tha Cold War is over. We thought there was no need to take any additional protective measures, because we viewed ourselves as an integral part of the world community. We didn't have any equipment of our own. Our companies, our state institutions and administrative departments, they were buying everything - hardware and software. And we've got much equipment from the US, from Europe, and that equipment is used by the Intelligence Services and by the Defense Ministry. But recently we certainly have become aware of the threat that all of that poses. Only during recent years, have we started to think about how we can ensure technological independence, as well as security. Certainly we give it much thought, and we take appropriate measures....So the trust and openness of Russia, they were unprecedented. Unfortunately US didn't recognise that, they didn't want to take note of that and appreciate it.**."*
        - *"....**This process had been a long one. We had to catch up with the others. We've got a very good foundation. We have a very high education level and very good school of mathematics...And right now some of our Russian companies get $7 billion dollars or so yearly. They've become competitive in the software market, and they are also quite active in pursuing the hardware...We see supercomputers being built.**."*
        - *"....**Maybe when there is action, there is always a counteraction...You know, there was one prominent politician of the past, Winston Churchill. He was very firmly against Sovietism, but once the WWII started, he was a great advocate of working together with the Soviet Union, and he called Stalin a great war leader and revolutionary. And after WWII, as is well known, it was Churchill who initiated the Cold War. And when the Soviet Union made the first nuclear test, it was none other than Winston Churchill who announced the need for a co-existence of two systems. He was a very flexible person. But i think that deep down in his heart, his attitude toward Stalin never wavered, never changed....Stalin was a product of his era. You can demonise him however much you like. We try to talk about his merits in achiving victory over Fascism. Asd to his demonisation, there was such a person in history as Oliver Cromwell. He was a bloodthirsty man who arrived in power on the wave of a revolution and he turned into a dictator and tyrant. And monuments to him are still scattered all across Great Britain. Napoleon is deified. What did he do? He used the surge of evolutionary zeal and arrived in power. And he not just restored the monarchy, he pronounced himself Emperor. And he led France to a national catastrophe, to utter defeat. There are many situations, many people like that, more than enough in the world history. I think that excessive demoninisation of Stalin is one of the ways to attach the Soviet Union and Russia, to show that the Russia today has something originating from Stalinism. Well, of course we all have these birthmarks. What I am saying is that Russia has changed radically. Of course, something probably has remained in our mentality. However this does not mean that we should forget all the atrocities committed under Stalinism, the destruction of millions of our compatriots, the extermination camps. These things are not to be forgotten.**."*
        - *"...**What is oligarchy? It is the integration of money and power with a view to influence the decisions that are being taken and the final aim being the accumulation of wealth. My task was to differentiate between power and money. In 2008, i said many private enterpreneurs with whom i had not been acquainted with before, to my surprise they showed great qualities. They assumed great responsibility for the state of our enterprises, for keeping their employees, they were even willing to risk their capital....I am hopeful that, in compliance with the legislation, we are going to continue to develop our private businesses. But as of now, the issue of oligarchs and power is not as acute as it used to be in 1990s. We have a greater task now. We have to address the economic gap between the rich and those people with low level income...So as for the oligarchs, I do not see it as a problem anymore.**."*
        - *"...**You have an opinion of your own, you have a talent, you have a chance to show this talent, and you have a chance to leave a great legacy behind. Money doesn't bring this kind of happiness.**."*
        - *"...**The leaders of the former Soviet Union were also checked out and the system still collapsed. So the question is not about selection. The question you have asked whether Russia needs anyone that bad - Russia itself will decide. An alteration in power certainly has to exist. Indubitable, there needs to be a healty competition in thse processes, but this competition should be among people who have in mind the interest of the nation. In the end, let me iterate - the citizens of Russia are going to make the final decision.**."*
        - *"...**Do you think our goal is to prove anything to anyone? Our goal is to reinforce our country. We are not talking about survival, and we are not trying to justify ourselves. Certainly taking into account all negative tendencies you've been talking about - the Soviet legacy, it's something in the past. But we also have to think about the positive legacy. Russia has been built for 1000 years; it has its own traditions. We have our notions of what is just and unjust, we have our own understanding of what defines an efficient government...**."*

And in accordance with these trends, in accordance with the change and changing world, it is necessary of course, to adapt international organisations accordingly...But to close them down or leave them - it seems to me that there is no point in this**......Because the Russian language is both the soul and founcation of Russian culture....But since then, the struggle between Westernism and nationalists, and so on, began in Russia...**We often slide into an extreme unfortunately. We always lack pragmatism. We should not be ashamed to take all the best that is available anywhere..At the same time, we must never forget our roots, we must rely on tradition, and thus, acting pragmatically, achieve the maximum result for ourselves.**.."*

It also reflects their ability to comprehend, accept and develop all the best things rather than underscore the differences, to find commonality, rise to the height of mutual spiritual enrichment and go forward together. These principals have been close to Russia and our people throughout our history. A country-civilisation, Russia has carefully kept the languages and traditions of all peoples living in it and is a unique unity of a multitude of distinctive cultures. The experience of the millenium-old history of our country convincingly shows that cultural diversity is the greatest blessing while the interaction of cultures is one of the conditions for stable and peaceful development. ...only culture can ensure the safety and reasonability of innovation. Culture is the most ethical regulator of technological progress...**."*
