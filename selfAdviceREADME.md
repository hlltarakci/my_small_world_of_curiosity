- [**Be understanding**](https://www.trackinghappiness.com/how-to-be-more-understanding/) - **Try perspective-taking.** **Don’t make judgements too quickly.** **Listen and listen some more.**  **Ask genuine questions.** **Understand yourself.** **Remember we are not perfect.**
- [**Be more patient and calm**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfmsNW7lf8c) - **Ask self introspective questions (ask why several times to get to the bottom).

- **Live!!**  Quote from Oguz Atay, The Disconnected: [**"Yatağımın karşısında bir pencere var. Odanın duvarları bomboş. Nasıl yaşadım on yıl bu evde? Bir gün duvara bir resim asmak gelmedi mi içimden? Ben ne yaptım? Kimse de uyarmadı beni. İşte sonunda anlamsız biri oldum. İşte sonum geldi. Kötü bir resim asarım korkusuyla hiç resim asmadım; kötü yaşarım korkusuyla hiç yaşamadım."**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/745010-tutunamayanlar)

- **Go with the flow. When we accept what is, we are free to act in accordance with reality.** - [**12 Practical Steps for Learning to Go With the Flow**](https://zenhabits.net/12-practical-steps-for-learning-to-go-with-the-flow) - *"**Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don’t resist them – that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.**"* - *"**What is going with the flow? It’s rolling with the punches. It’s accepting change without getting angry or frustrated. It’s taking what life gives you, rather than trying to mold life to be exactly as you want it to be.**."*
