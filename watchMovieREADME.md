Beware of the Car (Russian: Береги́сь автомоби́ля) is one of the more interesting entries into the canon of great Soviet films – its a boisterous, hilarious and often outrageously revolutionary comedy-of-manners that combines genres in wonderfully inventive ways, and coerces us into one of the most intrepid journeys into the roots of Soviet culture made during this film. Daring and extraordinarily complex in its intentions, but incredibly simple in how it realizes them, Beware of the Car overcomes its more vague political underpinnings by being an exceptionally charming comedy that is nothing short of an exuberant exercise in building a memorable story from the fragments of a difficult moment in history...It’s never entirely clear whether Beware of the Car is in support of the political beliefs of the Soviet Union, or if it is an immensely complex critique that conceals itself so well, it actually portrays the state in a positive life. However, whether mildly propagandistic or brilliantly subversive, the film is taking inspiration from the pure ideological roots of the system as a way of constructing a wonderfully potent dark comedy that is made with the intensity of many of Hollywood’s great film noirs, adding in the acerbic Eastern European wit that goes underappreciated far too often...One of the rare Soviet comedies that is more upbeat than it is sardonically satirical, Beware of the Car is a wonderful triumph, an effortlessly entertaining caper that is as thrilling as it is heartfelt, taking a simple story and turning it into a perfectly-calibrated comedy that touches on social issues, which remaining as endearing and delightful from the first scintillating moment of unhinged comedy, to the poignant ending scene, where the themes of the film dovetail in an unexpectedly moving way, proving Beware of the Car to be nothing less than a positively powerful work of mild-mannered, mid-century mayhem with a great sense of humour and a lot of authentic soulfulness.*](https://postmodernpelican.com/2020/04/30/beware-of-the-car-1966/)

The film never condemns Boris as well, for deciding to enlist in the war and abandoning young Veronica. Boris and Veronica are both young and naive lovers who fortunately don't know and yet understand the cruel realities of life...At the heartbreaking and at the same time life affirming conclusion of the film, Veronica accepts that her lover Boris is dead and comes to the realization that she is not the only one who is mourning. She decides to pass out flowers that she originally brought for Boris to the thousands of other families who are in mourning, as Fyodor joins her which in a way is showing her that the family loves and forgives her."*](https://www.classicartfilms.com/the-cranes-are-flying-1957)

After the revolution, the Bolsheviks understood how to use this religious vigilance of the Russian people. They realized they could replace the monarchy and the church with power embodied in the cult of one man, Stalin. Hence people held the socialist system in the same light as the church. How could people have constructed factories and miles of highways in two weeks? People would die on the building sites in order to construct Communism...In the film, Serguei Petrovitch Kotov, the Red Army colonel and hero of the revolution, does not exude the image of one who could be accused of treason. When Stalin's political police force, the NKVD, comes to arrest him, Serguei remains very calm, expecting to resolve everything with a simple phone call to the Kremlin. But when the arresting officers turn violent, Serguei understands.
...It is very important that none of the three characters lie. Each one in this situation tries to tell the truth, accepting the possible risks...In Russia it is often said "don't fear your enemy, the worst he can do is kill you. Don't fear your friend, the worst he can do is betray you. But fear indifference. Because by its silence, its tacit accord, it can kill you and betray you."....It is not possible for me as a Russian to say that "this is good and that is not." As Pushkin said, "That would be like trying to explain harmony by algebraic calculations." In Russia, a thief can give his shirt to a stranger. This stranger can then rob a house, but if the house catches on fire, he will do everything he can to save the sleeping baby. Good and bad are intertwined. That is the harmonious reality and paradox of Russia."*](https://www.sonyclassics.com/burntbysun/misc/interview.html)

His creations showed the world a miracle of harmony, beauty, light, hope - and all this at a time when the country is torn apart by princely civil strife, and Tatar raids, famine and pestilence are chasing the people. The film is divided into eight short stories, which have little plot connection with each other, but paint a general picture of medieval Russia, which is taking shape like a mosaic work."* - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Rublev_(film)) - [Andrei Rublev: the best arthouse film of all time](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/andrei-rublev-tarkovsky-arthouse) *"Despite its apparent formlessness, Andrei Rublev is precisely structured and entirely aesthetically coherent."* - [Cinematic gold: Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev](https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/cinematic-gold-tarkovskys-andrei-rublev) *"With Sergei Eisenstein, Andrei Tarkovsky is perhaps the most influential of all Russian filmmakers.

The problem is that, like life itself, the film does not come into focus until you begin to strip out the extraneous detail and simplify the image...It is the comparison between the experiences of Rublev and those of the bell-maker that really brought the film into focus for me...Tarkovsky viewed his audience as collaborators and accepted that the meanings they created for themselves were at least as valid as the ones that inspired him to make the films in the first place."*

Closely observed by the powers that be, war movies were the most likely type of film to be shown at international festivals and get proper distribution...moved away from combat and focused instead on the individual ordeals and suffering of those whose lives are irretrievably crippled by war...Like Ivan’s, Tarkovsky’s childhood was spent during the war...Sergei Urusevsky’s mastery of the camera greatly impressed Tarkovsky, and many of the decisions related to mise-en-scène, camera movement, and scene choreography in Ivan’s Childhood clearly follow the aesthetic model introduced by the cinematographer.."*](https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/589-ivan-s-childhood-dream-come-true) - [Sinemada Ufkum Açılsın Diyenlerin İzlemesi Gereken Film: Ivan'ın Çocukluğu](https://eksiseyler.com/sinemada-ufkum-acilsin-diyenlerin-izlemesi-gereken-film-ivanin-cocuklugu)

Instead, I’m referring to the countless directors who worked to produce comedies, which have proven to be some of the most refreshing and entertaining ever made...Amongst them is Leonid Gaidai, who is certainly the most significant name if we are discussing Soviet-era comedies – a classically trained director who happened to do almost all of his best work in the genre of outrageous, off-the-wall comedies, he has been a steadfast representative of the depths of Russian humour for so many decades, but yet remains relatively unknown to outsiders...For every derisive comment that claims that Russian cinema is dense, dour and humourless, there is a film like Kidnapping, Caucasian Style, which proves this could not be further from the truth, and that the perception that Russian art is overly long and miserable is a misconception, especially since some of the funniest and most captivating comedies ever made were produced under Soviet rule...There is a reason Gaidai is called the “King of Soviet Comedy” – no one was ever able to make films at the level that he was, and it is very likely that every successful comedy produced during this era was either made by him or inspired by his work."*

It’s more than a cinephile talking point. It’s more than “the best horror movie ever” or “the most disturbing depressing movie ever”. This film was a statement. A reminder of real history. This was Klimov’s way of de-romanticizing / caricaturing Nazis, as the tradition had been in Hollywood. 27 million people died in the USSR during the war, compared to 400,000 US soldiers in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters combined. The sheer terror of Nazi occupation in the East is something no one in the west can really understand. The stats are clear on the treatment of prisoners and citizens between the two halves of Nazi occupied Europe - the Nazis sought to eradicate the Slavic peoples - Vernichtungskreig, a war of annihilation."*
