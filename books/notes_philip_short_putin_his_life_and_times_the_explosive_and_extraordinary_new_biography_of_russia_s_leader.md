- *"Almost every language in use in the world today has a generally accepted form of transliteration into English. Russian does not. Although various romanisations exist, none has yet established itself as a universal standard, partly, perhaps, because most require special characters and diacritical marks. The result is a hodgepodge in which names are spelt in a bewildering variety of ways."*
- *"Russian names always include the patronymic – thus, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin; his father, Vladimir Spiridonovich; his grandfather, Spiridon Ivanovich, and so on, the middle name deriving from the father’s given name. The combination of forename and patronymic is the polite form of address, ‘Vladimir Vladimirovich’ in Russian being the equivalent of ‘Mr Putin’ in English."*

- *"...several possibilities were being considered. Two involved changing the constitution, either to give greater independence to Russia’s 89 constituent regions, making the country a confederal rather than a federal state, or to consummate a long-discussed Union between Russia and Belarus, with Yeltsin as President and the Belarussian leader, Aleksandr Lukashenko, as Vice President. In either case, a new constitution would have to be written which would mean that the elections would be delayed. The third possibility, was to create a situation justifying the declaration of a state of emergency..."*
- *"..'For the first time, responsibility for the bombings of the apartment buildings in Russia has been clearly [ascribed] to the presidential family and, personally, to the head of the government, Vladimir Putin, as the de facto sponsor and organiser of the explosions. This charge is too serious … to be ignored...In a country where, over the centuries, people have learnt to expect the worst from their rulers, and where the news media, not long freed from the iron grip of Soviet censorship, had a pronounced tendency to confuse fiction with fact, Russians reacted to these claims more phlegmatically than might have been expected...**Putin took charge of the war and the tough, no-nonsense manner in which he approached the conflict resonated with Russians.**."*
- *"**..if the FSB, or even elements within it, had participated in the bombings, it would have been impossible to maintain secrecy for so long.**..**the British services had ‘a lot of penetration’ in Russia at that time. Had there been serious evidence of FSB participation, he says, MI6 would certainly have learnt of it.**...Shamil Basayev was quoted as saying after the first explosion in Moscow that it was ‘not our work, but the work of the Dagestanis’. That was probably true but it was a nuance."*
- *"..Berezovsky financed a television documentary, ‘The Assassination of Russia’, and two books about the bombings, Blowing Up Russia and Lubyanskaya prestupnaya gruppirovka [‘The Lubyanka Criminal Group’], co-authored by Aleksandr Litvinenko, a former FSB officer whose murder in London with radioactive polonium would later make worldwide headlines."*
- *"..**The saga of the apartment bombings illustrates two of the main difficulties confronting anyone who seeks to penetrate the mysteries of Putin’s Russia."**..The first: **American tendency to view every enemy as ‘a perfect model of malice, a kind of amoral superman – sinister, ubiquitous, powerful, cruel … [who] profits from the misery he has produced.**.."*

- *"..To Russia, the relationship with America is far more important than any other. For much of the time since the 1950s, America regarded Russia the same way.. The two countries are antinomes, halves of a unique dyad which neither forms with any other nation. Both think of themselves as exceptional, which is a recipe for mutual incomprehension, if not animosity, no matter who occupies the Kremlin or the White House...**Europe follows America’s lead, though in less polarised fashion. Geographically, Europe is closer and more conscious of the need to find ways to coexist with its giant neighbour.**.."*
- *"..**National leaders invariably reflect the societies from which they come, no matter how unpalatable that thought may be to the citizens of the countries concerned. Putin is no more an aberration in Russia than Donald Trump in America, Boris Johnson in Britain or Emmanuel Macron in France. He represents the hopes and fears, the aspirations and anguish, the conceits and resentments of a substantial part of the Russian population, who regularly support him. To try to work out why Putin behaves as he does, why under his tutelage Russia has become the country it is and what may lie ahead, both while he remains its leader and under his successors, it is necessary to put aside stereotypes and examine each piece of evidence for what it is, soberly and without prejudgement.**."*
- *"..Normally a biographer’s task is to expound the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of his subject’s life: the underlying facts are rarely in dispute. With Putin, that is often not the case. **As with the apartment bombings, widely accepted assumptions turn out on closer scrutiny to be partial, misleading or downright wrong. That is part of a long tradition in Russia.** Winston Churchill’s famous definition of Kremlinology as **watching ‘a bulldog fight under a rug – an outsider only hears the growling, and when he sees the bones fly out from beneath it is obvious who won’ – has been true of Russian governance since the sixteenth century or earlier.** **The Kremlin does not yield its secrets easily. The broad outline may be clear, but the devil is in the details and the details matter. If enough details change, the overall picture changes too.**.."*
- *"..The purpose of this book..**to explore Putin's personality, to understand what motivates him and how he has become the leader that he is. It has no agenda other than to establish as fully and accurately as possible the facts of his life and career, his truths and his lies, his successes and failures and the context in which he operates, and to set them out with sufficient clarity for readers to be able to make an informed judgement themselves.**."*
- Chapter 1 - Baskov Lane - *"...Putin’s early childhood was both cosseted and unusually free. Cosseted because, within the limits of what was possible for a working-class family in post-war Leningrad, his parents did everything they could for him; free because he was spared **the discipline of Soviet preschool education, where play was combined with collective responsibility and the teachers instilled simple precepts of morality that would not have been out of place in a Victorian dame school. Even three-year-olds were expected to help clean up after lessons, clear the tables and, in winter, clear away snow.**...At home, there was none of that. His mother taught him to read and write and learn his numbers, but when he was done, he could go out and play."*
- *"...The school year in Russia starts on September 1, unless it happens to be at a weekend...‘First Bell Day’.."*
- *"..As a schoolteacher I can say that you can divide parents into two groups: those who care and those who don’t. [Putin’s] school, School 193, was for kids from families which didn’t care.."*
- *"..**In Russian schools, a child who misbehaved was punished by emotional pressure – the teacher would act coldly and express disappointment – rather than by physical correction, which was forbidden. The goal was to internalise obedience, so that the child would behave well not out of fear of retribution but to win the teacher’s, and his peers’, affection.** To Putin, who had been brought up at home, that was all very new and strange."*
- *"..**The school rules, which every child had to learn by heart, enjoined them ‘not to arrive late for classes; to sit upright during the lesson, not leaning on the elbows or slouching; to listen attentively … and not to let [their] attention wander to other things; to be respectful to the school director and teachers and, when meeting them, to greet them with a polite bow – boys should also raise their caps; and to cherish the honour of school and defend it as their own.**."*

- *"..In later life, Putin wrote that he had been a hooligan as a child...'It wasn’t so much that conflicts sought him out, it was he who was always looking for conflicts.'...He had no fear. **He didn’t seem to have an inner instinct for self-preservation.** It never occurred to him that the other boy was stronger and might beat him up...**He wasn’t the strongest in our class, but in a fight he could beat anyone, because he would get into a frenzy and fight to the end.**...**he had ‘both aggressiveness and common sense. At first glance, it seems they are total opposites … But in fact, they complement each other.**...Although he showed little interest in his studies and was spurned by the Pioneers, his classmates respected him for his audacity and for the way he rushed to the defence of his friends."*
- *"**Vladimir Putin grew up in a city more deeply scarred by the Second World War, or the Great Patriotic War, as Russians usually call it, than any outsider can begin to comprehend. For Americans in particular, whose country has never been invaded by a hostile power, and even for Western Europeans, who saw cities like Coventry, Dresden and Warsaw reduced to rubble, it is hard to grasp the enormity of what happened during the Leningrad blockade. After Hitler’s troops surrounded the city in September 1941, with orders not to occupy it but to let the population starve, three quarters of a million Leningraders perished, most of them in the famine winter of 1941–2, when Putin’s brother, Viktor, died, and the ration for dependants was reduced to a few ounces of ersatz bread a day. That was four times the death toll in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, and 35 times more than in the London Blitz. In this one Russian city, more people died than all the Americans who have died in every foreign war the United States has ever fought.**."*
- *"In terms of physical damage, Leningrad suffered less than cities like Stalingrad or Smolensk or Novgorod, where hardly a single building was left standing. But the physical scars of war can be repaired. By the time Putin was born, most of the centre of the city had been rebuilt. **The psychological scars went far deeper. Each person reacted differently.** A few talked compulsively about what they had endured. But most, like Putin’s parents, buried it deep inside. As one blockade survivor put it, **memories of that time were ‘a minefield within the mind. You only have to step on them and you blow up. Everything flies to hell – quiet, comfort, present-day happiness.’** In Putin’s family, the war was discussed only when relatives who had spent the war years elsewhere came to visit. From listening to those conversations, Volodya began to understand what his parents had endured."*
- *"..'One does not know what to marvel at more: the madness of those who gave the orders or the courage of those who carried them out.'..."*
- *"...Putin told the story often, including to Hillary Clinton during a summit meeting in 2012. **The details changed at almost every telling. That does not make it untrue. Psychological research has shown that when traumatic events are recalled, recollections vary over time even when the person concerned was not a direct participant.**."*
- *"...There had been cannibalism in the army, in the prisons and among the civilian population...But those were merely fleeting glimpses of a blockade which had lasted nearly 30 months..."*
- *"..**Stalin saw the city, historically Russia’s gateway to the West, as a weak link in the new Iron Curtain. Leningrad’s artists and intellectuals were accused of ‘cringing servility towards bourgeois culture’. A ferocious purge began, which coincided with renewed famine**, as the Soviet grain harvest was hit by drought and a distribution system wrecked by war proved unable to cope with the vast population movements that followed the German defeat."*
- *"..But that year another purge started. Leningrad’s wartime leader, Andrei Zhdanov, who had been seen as Stalin’s probable successor, died of a heart attack, triggering a covert power struggle between the KGB Chief, Lavrenty Beria, and his rival, Georgy Malenkov. In what later became known as the Leningrad Affair, Zhdanov’s former colleagues were executed and some 2,000 other officials, reaching down to the level of factory Party Committees, were sent to labour camps. It was not the best time to try to start a family. **Russia, unlike Europe and America, had no post-war baby boom.**...A group of Jewish doctors had been accused of trying to kill the Soviet leadership in the so-called ‘Doctors’ Plot’, which Stalin had concocted as justification for yet another massive purge."*
- *"...**Privacy was unknown. Until quite recent times, the Russian language had no word for it. Communal living was a long-established tradition.**...It was primitive. **But Putin would say later that he ‘never felt disadvantaged or miserable’.** It was the way everybody lived and the grown-ups had all known much worse."*
- *"...The memory stayed with him, and years later he would draw the lesson: **‘No one should be cornered. No one should be put in a situation where they have no way out.'**."*
- *"...Khrushchev’s message was mixed: Lenin had been good but Stalin had been wicked; the system was correct but Stalin had betrayed it...The Secret Speech triggered unrest in Poland and an uprising in Hungary...The ‘Khrushchev Thaw’, as it was called, reached its apogee with the removal in 1961 of Stalin’s embalmed body from the mausoleum on Red Square, where he had lain in state beside Lenin, for reburial at the foot of the Kremlin Wall...Khrushchev held that a new world war was no longer inevitable, as Stalin had believed, but East and West could practise peaceful coexistence..."*
- *"..**In Soviet schools in Stalin’s time, children were expected to be docile and unquestioning. Under Khrushchev, that changed. There was no return to the years immediately after 1917, when rebelliousness was seen as a revolutionary virtue. But children were once again encouraged to be more independent and assertive."**...Whether for this reason, or because he was now older and starting to think about what he wanted to do with his life, in 1965, when Volodya was twelve, his behaviour began to improve...Why he chose German rather than English, which was much more popular, he never explained: it may have been curiosity about the Soviet Union’s enemies in the war, a desire to do something different from the majority of his classmates or simply because he liked his new teacher...**Under the Soviet system, teachers were expected to work closely with families, especially when a child proved difficult and in need of extra help. If the family did not pull its weight, considerable pressure could be brought to bear, including criticism at mass meetings at the parents’ places of work.**."*
- *"..To maintain the kind of leadership I had,’ he explained later, ‘it needed real physical strength and skills. I wanted to keep that kind of leadership … I knew that if I didn’t start sport, then in the courtyard and at school, I would no longer have the position I was used to.'.."*
- *"..'If I hadn’t got involved in sports, I’m not sure how my life would have turned out. It was sports that got me off the streets.'...But Volodya himself was maturing. His efforts at self-control, which Borisenko had remarked upon a year earlier, had progressed. **When he wrestled, the moment a bout was over, it would be as though the fight had never happened. The change was so sudden that it drew the coach’s attention – an ability to switch instantly from aggression to friendliness was an unusual quality, he thought.** He noticed, too, that whether Volodya won or lost, nothing showed in his face. ‘He was very reserved … At such moments, it was impossible to tell what he was feeling.’ Not to show emotions was one of the key principles of both sambo and judo...intuitively he had somehow grasped the essence of the philosophy behind it."*
- *"Part of the change was due to the realisation that important choices were looming. In working-class districts of Soviet cities in those days, when a boy reached fourteen, a boundary was crossed. Either he stayed with the other teenagers in the courtyard, where the older boys fought with bicycle chains, gambled and drank, and vied to become gang leaders, in which case he was on track for a criminal record, which the others would consider a badge of honour. Or he turned his back on that world and applied himself at school in the hope of gaining admission to a technical institute or, if he was really gifted, university. Khrushchev’s reforms had on the whole been extremely positive for children of Putin’s generation, bringing new possibilities unimaginable to their parents, but increased access to higher education was not one of them...It was impossible to enter university without being a member of the Komsomol, the Communist Party Youth League. But to join the Komsomol, it was necessary first to have been a Pioneer."*
- *"...Pavel Morozov...The story was controversial. On the one hand, Russian tradition and Party policy stressed the importance of the patriarchal family structure. On the other, it was a perfect example of a child who put his revolutionary duty first. Even Stalin had mixed feelings. ‘What a little swine, denouncing his own father,’ he was said to have commented privately."*
- *"School, Pioneers and family were expected to work together to inculcate socialist values. Each class formed a Pioneer detachment, which was divided into ‘links’, each composed of five or six children, which competed among themselves. If a child failed to pull his weight, the whole link was criticised and the slacker denounced in the class’s wall newspaper. Conversely, if he or she did particularly well, the link, not the individual, was praised. The lesson was that the judgement of the group was primordial, the individual was subordinate, and speaking out against the failings of one’s comrades was not only morally correct but in a child’s own interests, because otherwise he or she would be held jointly responsible for the others’ mistakes...The family, in turn, was expected to inform the school how the child behaved at home, whether he or she was obedient and helped with the household chores...In practice, as with most things in the Soviet Union, theory and reality diverged."*
- *"Having spent years as the class troublemaker, Putin found himself, in seventh grade, head of its Pioneer Council...Like the Scouts, the Pioneers exalted patriotism. The Pioneer Code, which they all had to learn by heart, declared: ‘a Pioneer honours the memory of those who gave their lives in the struggle for freedom and for the flowering of the Soviet motherland.’**To Volodya and his classmates, as to children throughout the Soviet Union, that was no abstract formula. All of them had lost relatives in the war.** The school arranged visits to battlefields and to memorial sites, including Leningrad’s Piskaryovskoe cemetery, where his brother, Viktor, was buried. **Patriotism was coloured by Russian nationalism. Teachers emphasised the genius of Russian cultural figures – Chekhov, Dostoyevsky and Pushkin, and the composers, Mussorgsky and Tchaikovsky – and the role of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great in consolidating Muscovite power and the expansion of Russian territory.**."*
- *"..**unusually independent-minded: 'He might agree or disagree with others, but it didn’t change what he thought.' Viktor Borisenko had the same impression. ‘Making him do something by force was simply impossible. The only person who could really influence him was himself.'..Even his closest friend, Borisenko, said later that **there was an unspoken boundary in their relationship which he knew he should never cross. ‘With him it was like this,’ Borisenko said, ‘He seemed to be with the rest of us, but he stood a little bit aside. He would take part in an event, but even though he was taking part in it, he was looking at it from outside. He had his own point of view in everything.'**."*
- *"On camping trips, they sang together **the bitter-sweet songs of Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava, two very different, immensely talented poets whose lyrics were at the limit of what the Soviet system could accept, but who both – especially Vysotsky, whose music even Brezhnev liked – had protection in high places.**."*
- *“In short, Putin lived what for his generation in Leningrad was the life of a normal teenager."*
- *"...The same singleness of purpose would soon lead him to make a much more important and more difficult decision than enrolling in a key school. But before that could happen, he had to get clear in his own mind what he wished to do with his life...**In the 1950s and early ’60s, most Russians genuinely believed in the superiority of communism. It was true that the reality of their lives did not live up to the Party’s promises. But both older people and the younger generation felt that Soviet society had a moral compass, in contrast to the capitalist West where the law of the jungle prevailed, and that, whatever the difficulties, the country was headed in the right direction. After Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, that ceased to be the case.** Party leaders closed their eyes to corrupt deals by lower-level officials in return for a share of the proceeds. Schoolteachers accepted favours to give children better marks; doctors to give patients better treatment; policemen to overlook offences. It did not happen all at once and it did not affect everyone. Some, including Putin’s father, remained true believers all their lives. But gradually, over time, there was a creeping erosion of faith. To counter that, Brezhnev and his Politburo colleagues placed ever greater emphasis on ideological orthodoxy."*
- *"...inakomyslyashchie, ‘those who think differently’....But that was exactly why Brezhnev had been appointed. He was a safe pair of hands who could be relied on to restore stability and make life predictable again. The innovation and excitement of the Khrushchev era were over...The new emphasis on ideological correctness made itself felt in the Komsomol. Already as Pioneers, children had been exhorted to ‘understand the superiority of the Soviet system over the 'bourgeois system’. Now they were expected to ‘raise their theoretical and ideological level’ by studying Marx and Lenin in order ‘to produce a new type of person’."*
- *"...Yuri Andropov...Oleg Kalugin, wrote that ‘he genuinely believed that the United States and the West were working day and night to destroy the Soviet Union.’ A year later, during what became known as the Prague Spring, when Czechoslovak communists attempted to loosen Soviet control and introduce a more democratic system, Andropov was convinced that it was due to Western meddling and must be put down by force...Andropov attempted to restore lustre to the KGB’s image, which had been catastrophically tarnished in the 1950s by Khrushchev’s revelations of its crimes under Stalin."*
- *"Television series like The Shield and the Sword and **Seventeen Moments of Spring**, which related the exploits of Soviet agents in Nazi Germany during the Second World War, depicted intelligence officers as selfless patriots and heroes, defending the homeland at the risk of their lives."*
- *"**The KGB, as Andropov conceived it, had a dual role: to defend Russians against ‘corrupting influences’ from abroad, by persuasion if possible – ‘prophylactic work’, as it was called – and by repression if not; and to use all possible means to weaken the ability of the Western powers to undermine the Soviet system.**"*
- *"....'What amazed me most of all was how one man’s effort could achieve what whole armies could not. One spy could decide the fate of thousands of people'....If Putin concentrated on sport, he said, he might well become a national champion...**'If you want to win a fight, you have to carry it through to the end, as if it were the most decisive battle of your life.'**."*
- Chapter 2 - Legal Niceties - *"Being at university was an eye-opener in other ways. Law students learnt about crime statistics and such things as sex offences which were never reported by the Soviet media. ‘We understood that not everything was as good as we were constantly told on television and in the newspapers,’ one student remembered....**Putin never openly called into question the prevailing orthodoxy. Unlike many of his fellow students, he did not listen to foreign radio stations. Events like the crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968 seem to have passed him by. That was in part because he had been brought up in a conventional Soviet proletarian family where politics was rarely discussed. But it also reflected the way that most Russians accepted as a matter of course the disconnect between Soviet ideals and the realities of everyday life.**."*
- *"..in the first year, he went to the Komi Republic, on the Arctic Circle in the northern Urals, where Vorkuta, one of the harshest forced labour camps in the Stalinist prison system, had been located. There, six weeks chopping lumber and helping to repair houses earned him almost a thousand roubles, more money than he had ever seen in his life. When he returned home, after giving presents to his family, he bought an overcoat. He wrote later that it was the first possession he had ever felt was truly his own..."*
- *"..Cheryomushkin (Putin's friend)..Putin was devastated. Borisenko remembered him at the funeral ceremony, standing by the coffin, ‘cold … and distant … Like a statue, not a single muscle moved on his face … He seemed alienated, completely closed.’ He found Putin’s lack of emotion shocking. Much later he learnt that afterwards, at the cemetery, when everyone else had left, and Putin and Cheryomushkin’s mother and sister, and another close friend, Kolya Alekhov, watched the coffin being lowered into the grave, **he had collapsed, weeping uncontrollably. ‘He cried for so long,’ Alekhov remembered, ‘none of us could calm him down.’ The icy demeanour which had repelled Borisenko was a front, a protective shell, to stop himself breaking down in public.**...‘There were moments,’ Borisenko said, ‘when Volodya became as if made of iron. I am talking about his inner attitude … He holds to the norms of behaviour … that have been instilled in him since childhood...Putin did not give up sport after Cheryomushkin’s death. He would have considered it weak, even disloyal, to have done so. He travelled all over the Soviet Union for competitions and, later that year, became a full Master of Sport at sambo, which meant he was ranked as a national champion. Two years later, he qualified as a Master of Sport in judo as well."*
- *"Putin was attracted to law not merely as a vehicle towards a career in the KGB. It interested him for its own sake. As a schoolchild, he once said, **he had never wanted others to recognise him as their chief. He preferred the role of arbitrator, ‘an unspoken leader, playing the role of the judicial branch, not the executive’** That memory was no doubt coloured by subsequent experiences: in the Soviet Union, arbitration did not have to be impartial...**All Soviet citizens, even children, knew that anyone whose actions were seen as inimical to the Soviet social, economic and, above all, political order risked exemplary punishment.**.."*
- *"A ‘parasitic way of life’ was illegal because earning money from activities other than those authorised by the state undermined the social system. ‘Speculation’, meaning buying and selling goods for a profit, was illegal because it undermined the economic system. Even such purely criminal offences as murder, rape and theft, had a political aspect, not only because they were socially disruptive but because they called into question the omnipotence of the state. For the same reason, fewer than one per cent of criminal trials ended in acquittal, because acquittals implied that the state, in the shape of the prosecutors, was mistaken. **The primary purpose of Soviet law, one writer concluded, was not to protect the citizenry but to ‘defend institutional authority by giving it an aura of legitimacy’**."*
- *"**There was no attempt to instil critical thinking or the ability to produce a reasoned argument, no Socratic questions and answers to draw out the students’ ideas. Instead, they were expected to learn by rote, in order to produce ‘the correct answer, the answer that the teacher wants’.**."*
- *"...Professor Olimpiad Ioffe, the university’s – and the Soviet Union’s – foremost authority on civil law. He had an entertaining, avuncular style, and lectured without notes. ‘Students from the senior classes used to come back just to hear him speak,’ one remembered. ‘Everything was from memory, and his memory was brilliant.’ Putin liked him"*
- *"'An operative must be inconspicuous, outwardly appearing as an ordinary person,’ a KGB general wrote. ‘I completely rejected those who were attracted to intelligence by romance or love of adventure. The best of those whom I selected looked the exact opposite of the image of an operative created in fiction.’ The last thing the service needed was someone who resembled James Bond. On almost every count – except, perhaps, his romanticising of the profession, which he tried hard not to let show – Putin was an ideal candidate...'If you were too enthusiastic, it wasn’t good, because it showed you had no character. But if you didn’t report anything, that meant that you were lazy. The KGB never sought out the best or the brightest students, nor did it want the dumb or lazy ones. It wanted well-balanced prospects.'."*
- *"**In the Soviet Union, students did not choose their future employment: they were told what their new posts would be when they graduated.**."*
- Chapter 3 - The Big House - *"..Leningrad Regional Directorate of the KGB, the Big House on Liteiny Prospekt.."*
- *"...Helsinki Final Act. The agreement was important to Brezhnev because it confirmed Europe’s post-war borders, effectively consolidating Moscow’s gains in the Second World War. But in return he had had to accept the so-called ‘third basket’ of the accords, under which the Soviet Union pledged support for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Helsinki turned into a rallying cry for dissidents in the Soviet Union and throughout Eastern Europe..."*
- *"**The new orthodoxy under Brezhnev was that Stalin had made some errors, but the system itself had been good.**."*
- *"At the **Dzerzhinsky School**, Putin was encouraged to take a broader view of intelligence work than he had in Leningrad. In the Fifth Department, his job had been to expose ‘anti-Soviet elements’ among the population. Now he was trained to seek information about Soviet émigré organisations and the activities of Western intelligence services. His main task would be to make contact with foreigners arriving in the Soviet Union who might be open to recruitment or ideological manipulation...Since the KGB worked on the principle that Western intelligence services were a mirror image of themselves, it followed that their adversaries would ‘do prophylactic work among their own citizens before they come to the Soviet Union … and, on their return, many of them will undergo questioning … to find out if they have been approached by Soviet intelligence.’"*
- *"...Arkady Raikin, Russia’s equivalent of Charlie Chaplin, whose skits and impersonations gently skewered the idiocies of Soviet bureaucracy and the rudeness, inefficiency and shortages which made everyday life in Russia such a cross to bear..."*
- *"...**He did not simply play his cards close to his chest, mask his emotions, and send out ambiguous signals: he maintained an impenetrable shell, which prevented even those closest to him from divining his true intentions.** One may legitimately wonder what prompted him to take the plunge. Putin himself said that his friends had urged him to get married and he realised that if he did not do so soon, he would stay a bachelor for ever, implying that it was a marriage of reason, rather than of love. That may well have been the case, although perhaps for a different motive. That spring, he had learnt that he might be in line for further training which could open the way to a post abroad. Married officers were preferred for foreign postings because a family was viewed as a source of stability. As Lyudmila remarked later, **whenever an important decision was to be taken, Volodya did not act spontaneously. ‘Everything he did was always thought through.'**."*
- *"...kokoshnik(коко́шник), the traditional Russian maids’ caps, a relic of tsarist times..."*
- *"...**Emphasis was placed on applied psychology. The books in the library included a Russian translation of Dale Carnegie’s How to Make Friends and Influence People and, even more than at the Dzerzhinsky School four years earlier, the instructors stressed the importance of ‘building interpersonal relationships’, without which, they insisted, no intelligence work was possible. Another course focused on analysis: how to anticipate trends, how to prioritise information and how to write reports. There was an ironclad rule: ‘One cable, one topic.’ If a message was intercepted and deciphered, only one topic would be compromised. They were taught how to recognise ‘dangles’, Western intelligence officers who turned up at Soviet embassies, posing as ‘walk-ins’ with important information to share. They learnt the different roles of ‘neutral contacts’ (people of no intelligence value whom an officer befriended in order to confuse an adverse counter-intelligence service); ‘information contacts’ (official sources whom he might meet in the course of his work, but with whom he had no intelligence relationship); ‘trusted contacts’ (persons whom the officer met publicly but with whom, secretly, he also had “an intelligence relationship); and ‘agents’ (who spied on his behalf). They practised ‘brush contacts’ (receiving a document from a source in a crowd without being seen), and the use of dead-letter drops, as well as of technical devices – tape recorders, concealed microphones and miniature cameras.**."*
- *"...It had taken Putin ten years in the service, almost to the day, to gain the position that he had dreamt of as a teenager, when his imagination had been caught by series like The Shield and the Sword and Seventeen Moments of Spring. It was not quite what he had hoped for all those years ago. Working in a provincial directorate had cured him of the romantic notions with which he had started out. **From an intelligence-gathering standpoint, East Germany was a province, not much different from Leningrad.**."*
- *"...**'Putin had the manners and behaviour of a special services officer.'** The label would stick. Senator John McCain famously remarked: ‘I looked in Putin’s eyes and I saw three letters: a K, a G and a B.'."*
- *"...Western newspaper articles invariably mention his KGB past, as though that in itself is enough to explain why he acts as he does. **But did the KGB form Putin? Or was he already, before he joined, in all important respects the person he would later become?** Putin himself is on record as saying that much of what he was taught in the KGB, he already knew long before. **If something happens, you should proceed from the fact that there is no retreat [he said]. It is necessary to carry it through to the end.** That’s a well-known rule that was taught by the KGB, but I learnt it much earlier, scrapping with other kids. There was another rule the KGB taught. **Don’t reach for a weapon unless you are prepared to use it** … It was the same on the street. [There] relations were clarified with fists. You didn’t get involved unless you were prepared to see it through...From judo he had learnt how to use others’ strengths against them and to exploit their vulnerabilities. At the Dzerzhinsky School he was taught that ‘all else being equal, the side which goes onto the attack will achieve the best results’, a principle the KGB called nastupatelnost, ‘offensive posture’. That, too, was familiar, both from judo and from his childhood fights."*
- *"Putin’s character fitted the kind of work the KGB did. **He liked to stay in the background and observe others, rather than to be the centre of attention himself. He was disciplined and pragmatic and able to concentrate his energies on the priority of the moment. He had been brought up not to show his emotions, which was another quality the KGB valued.**."*
- *"This is not to say that Putin gained nothing from his years with the KGB. But by the time he graduated from the Law Faculty, he was almost 23 years old and his personality was already formed. At the Dzerzhinsky School and the Red Banner Institute, he learnt new skills and techniques – how to manipulate an asset, how to analyse and evaluate information, how to distinguish the principal aspect of a problem from what was secondary. He was taught how to appraise contacts. Were they likely to be useful? If not, why waste time on them? Above all, he learnt never to take things at face value, to mistrust others’ motives and intentions. **Intelligence work is plagued by paranoia.** Is a source what he or she claims to be, or are they working for another service, deliberately laying a false trail? But here, too, there was already a firm foundation on which his instructors could build. **Even as a child, Volodya Putin had concealed his hand; as a young man, he did not vouchsafe information unless there was good reason.**."*
- *"**Putin’s time with the special services influenced his thinking and equipped him with new tools with which to view the world. But it did so by accretion. Putin was already Putin before he joined the KGB.**."*
- Chapter 4 - Quiet Days in Saxony - *"Like all Soviet visitors to East Germany, she was struck by the wealth of goods available in the shops, compared to what could be bought at home. So was Putin. ‘We had come from a Russia,’ he wrote later, ‘where there were long lines and shortages, and in East Germany there was always plenty of everything.’ Even bananas, which were unobtainable in the Soviet Union, could be bought in the army commissariat, to which, as a KGB officer, he had access. **It was the small details which Lyudmila noticed: the politeness of the shop assistants, who took time to find out what each customer wanted and to wrap each purchase individually, and then asked if they would like anything else, unlike their counterparts in Leningrad, who responded only to customers’ shouts and then snarled that there was none left; the fact that there were no queues, that the streets were clean, that Germans cleaned the windows of their apartments every week; and the orderly way in which German housewives hung out their washing each morning on clothes lines in the courtyard.**."*
- *"..Putin was left a bachelor and his eye began to wander...She found him attractive and he evidently felt the same way. That night, she remembered, he started drinking, which he rarely did in public, until, having got up his courage to kiss her, they engaged in some heavy petting. It was a brief lapse, which did not lead very far. Today she says that chapter of her life is closed: it was a youthful infatuation. But Putin had taken a serious risk. Neither the Stasi nor the KGB permitted extramarital relations. He had still not completely overcome his old problem of a ‘lowered sense of danger’."*
- *"At mealtimes, she remembered, ‘he was capricious … If he did not think a dish was done properly, he would rather not eat it at all.’ When she had made a particular effort to please him, and would wait, as she said, ‘with a sinking heart’ to hear his reaction, he would say, ‘the meat is rather dry.’ If it was really good he might say grudgingly, ‘not bad’. She consoled herself with the thought that he was just applying the old Russian adage: ‘Praise the woman, spoil the home.'."*
- *"Formally both he and Putin belonged to Line N...Line N officers had two principal tasks: identifying potential recruits who might be trained as illegal agents, and assembling documents and other material which could be used to create ‘legends’ as cover stories for them. Western intelligence services almost never use illegals: the investment required to train and disguise an illegal agent is out of all proportion to the likely return. But in Russia, old traditions die hard. The Cheka started using illegals out of necessity, rather than choice, at a time when the Soviet Union had no diplomatic relations with the United States and tenuous ties with other Western countries, which made it impossible to set up legal residencies under diplomatic cover.Putin later claimed that ‘all my work in foreign intelligence was connected … specifically with illegal intelligence’. That was stretching the truth. He may have spent some of his time with the First Department in Leningrad on Line N matters, but it was certainly not his main task there."*
- *"Agartanov called him ‘an ordinary representative of our profession, … polite, affable, alert and unobtrusive, [but] not in any way outstanding’. Viktor Adianov said he was ‘hardly a superspy … not someone who stood out from his colleagues’. Bragin said Putin was ‘on a par with everyone else, without any special achievements’. Both he and Adianov described him as a ‘workaholic’ and by comparison with them, he probably was, but to Agartanov he was ‘conscientious and no more than that’ and Matveyev concurred. On two points, however, Agartanov and Bragin agreed. **Putin had a way of ingratiating himself with older people. As Agartanov put it: ‘He was able to win over anyone he liked, but especially people his father’s age.’** They also thought that he was not ambitious. In Bragin’s words, ‘he did not dream of a career.'...if Putin did aspire to higher things during his time in Dresden, he took good care to hide it."*
- *"Perestroika, or ‘restructuring’, and glasnost, ‘openness’, the two signature programmes of the Soviet Union’s new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were then still in their infancy. Most people thought that they would be just another failed attempt at reform which in the end would lead nowhere. Gorbachev had taken power in March 1985, succeeding Brezhnev’s long-time aide, Konstantin Chernenko, and the former KGB chief, Andropov, both of whom had been in chronic ill health and lasted less than 15 months in office. **A year later his most visible achievement had been to launch a bitterly contested campaign against alcoholism.**..“But where Matveyev supported the campaign in principle, Putin did not. **Alcoholism, he agreed, was a scourge, but the only effective means of fighting it was to raise the general cultural level of society. His reasons were strictly practical. Prohibition drove the problem underground, boosting illegal production of home-distilled liquor and poisonous surrogates and provoking a senseless mass movement to uproot valuable vineyards.**....had seen former colleagues from the Fifth Department posted outside cinemas and bathhouses to enforce a campaign which Andropov had launched to stop officials skiving off during working hours. **That, too, he said, had been a mistake. It was an abuse of administrative measures and it did not solve the problem it was intended to address.**....**Eventually the anti-alcohol campaign was curtailed, though not for the reasons Putin had adduced. It was wound up because the state could not do without the revenue from vodka sales.**."*
- *"**Arguing was pointless, he told Agartanov: it changed nothing and only put oneself and one’s family at risk. ‘A person only has one life. Why waste it banging your head against a brick wall?'**...**The disconnect between what one could say and what one could think, which Soviet citizens had factored into their behaviour since childhood without reflecting overmuch on the implications, became harder to ignore in the altered climate of the 1980s.** In the KGB, that was especially true...young officers in the 1980s who ‘knew much more about the flaws in the system than their compatriots, became critical of events and began to realise the need for change and renewal. **They saw perfectly clearly that the system’s own absurdities were causing as much damage to the country as all the foreign intelligence agencies put together.**'.Putin had been struck by a conversation with a KGB colleague who had been with the Soviet army in Afghanistan. The man had told him that his main achievement there had been preventing pointless Soviet bombing raids. **Putin had already realised that the war had been a mistake. Even so, he said, he was stunned. ‘After discussions like that, you start to think and rethink things.’ By the late 1980s, Putin was rethinking a great deal. Vladimir Bragin concluded that Putin was no longer a communist.**."*
- *"...**Putin, in private considered communism an impossible dream..Putin had been deeply impressed by the private shops and small enterprises which the East German communists allowed to operate alongside the state sector. They were a different world from the grim, unwelcoming state stores at home with their empty shelves, bored shop hands and surly cashiers.75 Private ownership, Putin concluded, was key. If people were to be motivated, they had to be allowed to accumulate property and to pass it on to their children. If the economy was to develop, there had to be competition.**."*
- *"**In the first years of perestroika, Putin, like many others, had grave doubts about Gorbachev’s reforms. The problems, he argued, were systemic. Tinkering would achieve nothing.**."*
- *"..The exchange of favours, known as blat, had always been part of the Soviet system. But there was a difference between voluntarily giving preference to a friend; feeling obliged to give preference to a friend; and giving preference in return for a bribe. Putin held that the first was difficult to avoid. The second and third were inadmissible."*
- *"..Putin admired the Germans. They were orderly and diligent. They knew how to work and how to have fun without getting blind drunk as Russians did.84 There was of course a more troubling side, too. Visiting Buchenwald and the sites of other Nazi concentration camps, Agartanov wrote, **‘it was hard to believe that the satraps running these camps were the same Germans, brought up in the same way, with the same good manners, attending concerts of classical music … as those who accompanied us.’** But the ‘real eye-opener’, as Putin put it, was the backwardness of the East German political system. He had expected to be living in a European state. Instead he found himself in ‘a harshly totalitarian country, similar to what the Soviet Union had been 30 years earlier … The entire population was under surveillance as though they were still living in Stalin’s time.’ Perestroika and glasnost were anathema."*
- *"...‘hostile centres will immediately exploit glasnost and perestroika and use it as a cover for their operations … The fundamental issue is capitalism or socialism. If [Moscow] goes towards capitalism, we can forget about socialism.'..."*
- *"Gorbachev’s failure to stem the growth of nationalism was not the only sign that the Soviet system was beginning to flounder. The nuclear power plant explosion at Chernobyl in April 1986, had been a major blow to Soviet pride. So was the exploit of Matthias Rust, a young West German who, on May 28, 1987, a few days short of his nineteenth birthday, flew a light aircraft from Helsinki to Moscow, making a mockery of Soviet air defences, and landed near Red Square. **For the reformers in the Soviet leadership, both events had a silver lining. The first provided a rationale for ending excessive secrecy and promoting glasnost. The second gave Gorbachev a pretext for purging the hardliners in the military opposed to perestroika.**."*
- *"....At that point, Putin understood that the East German leaders were losing control. But even then, he said later, ‘I didn’t imagine that the regime would collapse so quickly.’...Nor did Mikhail Gorbachev....**The Berlin Wall had fallen. In the dramatic weeks between the beginning of October, when demonstrators stormed the Dresden railway station, and the breaching of the Wall on November 9, Putin watched impotently as history unfolded before his eyes. He said later that he understood intellectually that the situation in East Germany was unnatural and that ‘a position built on walls and divisions cannot last.’103 But that was with hindsight. When it happened, he could only stand and stare. Beyond East Germany’s borders, the Kremlin’s grip was weakening. In Ukraine, Rukh, a reformist-nationalist movement, was gaining strength with discreet support from Leonid Kravchuk, the wily Second Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party. In Kishinyov, the capital of Moldavia, anti-communist protesters burned down the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In Prague, after huge demonstrations and a general strike, the entire Communist Party leadership resigned and multi-party elections were called, as they had been earlier in Poland and Hungary, ending the Party’s monopoly of power. Shortly afterwards, Bulgaria followed suit. By the time the year ended, Romania’s communist regime, the last in the former Soviet bloc, had fallen and its leader, Nicolae Ceauşescu, and his wife had been executed.**."*
- *"It is possible that that night in Dresden did play a formative role. **Memories crystallise over time. ‘That business of “Moscow is silent”,’ Putin said later. ‘I got the feeling then that the country no longer existed … The [Soviet] Union was ailing. It had a terminal disease without a cure – a paralysis of power.’ But that was said more than a decade after, when he had different responsibilities and a very different agenda. In reality, it had been much less of a crisis than his memories made out. Far from having to wait several hours for military support, a patrol had been despatched to secure the building within thirty minutes.112 His boss at Karlshorst, Sergei Bezrukov, to whom he reported next day, remembered it as a minor episode of no particular importance. But for Putin, it was the culmination of weeks of frustration, as East Germany – a country which he had come to regard as a second home – fell apart, while the mighty Soviet Union did nothing to stop it.**."*
- *"...**He could understand that East Germans regarded their security service as a monstrous organisation, but it was the system which was wrong, not those who worked within it. ‘The people I knew were decent people,’ Putin insisted. ‘They were my friends and I will not renounce them.’** Some Stasi officers, he admitted, had ‘probably’ maltreated people, but he ‘personally did not see it’. It was the same reasoning that led him to minimise the horrors committed by the NKVD under Stalin. The state was a reflection of the society from which it came. So were its faults. In the middle of December, the KGB group in Dresden was ordered to start burning its archives. ‘We destroyed everything – all our communications, our lists of contacts and agent networks,’ Putin remembered. The office possessed an incinerator for that purpose, but the sheer volume of papers to be consumed was so great that it overheated and exploded."*
- *"...The truth was simpler. As Bezrukov suspected, Putin had been withdrawn to be given a new assignment – an assignment which would lay the groundwork for everything that followed. In May 1989, the Congress of People’s Deputies had held its opening session in Moscow. The debates, which were broadcast live, transfixed the Soviet public. For two weeks, the whole country was at a standstill. Factories stopped work, the ministries were idle. People spent their days glued to television sets and transistor radios, and the evenings discussing what they had heard....**Not a single sacred cow has escaped assault. The leadership have been cross-examined about their private lives. The Party has been accused of narrowmindedness, privilege, and corruption. The government has been accused of gross mismanagement. The army has been accused of mounting punitive expeditions against the civil population, and its invasion of Afghanistan called a shameful crime. The KGB has been publicly assailed for murder and torture. Even Lenin has not escaped entirely: the proposal to remove him from his mausoleum, which so infuriated the Party in April, was publicly repeated … What has been said – about the mismanagement of the economy, the weaknesses of the leadership, the bankruptcy of the Party, the brutality of the army and police – cannot be unsaid.** ...**In the past, criticisms like this had been heard only from the most outspoken dissidents. Now they were coming from reformers within the Communist Party itself.**."*
- *"...'When Sobchak stood up to speak – and I used to attend those sessions – people listened. He was scathing, critical, eloquent, brilliant … He was an orator and he was very clever … he was an impressive guy.’...At a time when most Soviet politicians still “dressed drably, he came to debates wearing an elegantly cut beige-and-white plaid jacket which made him look, as Yeltsin’s political strategist, Gleb Pavlovsky, put it, ‘as though he’d just walked off the Champs Elysées after shopping in a designer boutique’. It became such a trademark that in Soviet department stores, plaid jackets were referred to as ‘sobchaks’. Alfred Kokh, a young economist who would go on to become one of Yeltsin’s deputy Prime Ministers, thought ‘he looked just the way a real politician should … Handsome, impressive. Bold. Smart. Educated. An aristocratic spirit … We adored him. There was nobody like him … He was one of a kind.”*
- *"...Anatoly Chubais, the future head of Yeltsin’s privatisation programme..."*
- *"...Left to his own devices, Putin’s preferences would have been for Leningrad. **Russians are territorial: Putin was a Leningrader through and through.** His parents were nearly 80 years old and his mother was in poor health. Like other KGB officers at that time, he may also have had doubts about the future of the organisation. He had just seen his counterparts in the Stasi lose careers, which they had expected to last a lifetime, almost overnight. **The Soviet Union had abandoned its positions throughout Eastern Europe. No one could say for sure what lay ahead in Russia either. If his career in the security services were to come to an abrupt end, it would be better to deal with that in Leningrad than in an unfamiliar city like Moscow.**."*
- Chapter 5 - Back in the USSR - *"**After four years of perestroika, the crime rate in the Soviet Union was soaring and the economy was in free fall.** Although they had returned to Leningrad on holiday each summer, the penury in the shops, after the plenty of Dresden, still came as a shock. To buy sugar, you needed a ration card and, starting on February 1, 1990, two days before they arrived, other basic foodstuffs could be purchased only with an identity card, proving residence in the city. **‘There were terrible lines [and] empty shelves,’ Lyudmila remembered. ‘For a while after we “returned home, I was even afraid to go to the store … I wasn’t able, like some people, to sniff out all the bargains … I would just … buy whatever was most necessary and go home. It was horrible.’** To make matters worse, because of the initial uncertainty over where Putin was to work, there was a dispute over which department should pay his salary. That took three months to resolve and they almost ran out of money. **But the most striking change was in people’s attitudes. Not only had living conditions, already bad in the mid 1980s, deteriorated further in the four and a half years the family had been away, but ordinary citizens now said openly, with all the grim melodrama which Russians affect at such times, exactly what they thought of their lives, their government and a future in which they saw nothing good. The words on everyone’s lips were razval and grazhdanskaya voina, ‘collapse’ and ‘civil war'.**"*
- *"'All the antagonisms which had earlier been contained [are] bursting out into the open: the desire for independence on the part of the border republics; the grumbling of those at the base of the political-economic pyramid against those in the upper echelons; the inevitable search for scapegoats – in which old-line Stalinists in the Party apparat join forces with right-wing nationalists against the Jews and the Judeo-masonic conspiracy … **Add to that a generalised mistrust of the currency, fuelled by fears of economic and monetary reform; endemic food shortages in parts of the Russian Federation; increasingly open activity by all kinds of mafia organisations; accelerating disruption of the tissue of economic production and of all public services (transport, communications, health, justice); a vertiginous rise in criminality; the collapse of the family unit … and you have some idea of the moral disarray in which the population of the Soviet Union finds itself.'**."*
- *"**'Russia has become the slum of the industrialised world,’ another Western diplomat wrote. ‘Its environment is devastated and its health system in crisis.’ Drunkenness was such a problem that in some parts of the Soviet Union, one child in six was born mentally retarded from an alcoholic mother. In Leningrad, with its endless winters, half the streetlights did not work and the roads were full of potholes. The most popular Soviet film that year – a comparison between life in Russia and life in the West – was entitled Tak zhit nelzya, ‘We Can’t Live like This’.**."*
- *"..That spring, Putin’s boss, the Vice Rector, Yuri Molchanov, reached agreement with the US beauty products company, Procter and Gamble, to set up a joint venture. In return for a small share of equity, the university provided office accommodation and an entrée to the city’s political and economic elite. **Putin was not directly involved, but it opened his eyes to the possibilities that economic cooperation with Western companies might bring.**."*
- *"**If it was difficult to adjust to the social and economic upheaval, it was even harder to come to terms with the political transformation that Russia was undergoing. It had been one thing to sit in Dresden, reading liberal magazines like Ogonyok and Novy mir and watching Soviet television. It was quite another to be plunged into the midst of a city, and a country, in ebullition, where the rules today bore little relation to what they had been yesterday or what they might become tomorrow.**."*
- *"...In February, less than a week after his return, the Central Committee, meeting in Moscow, voted to end the Party’s ‘leading role’ and install presidential rule – **momentous decisions which fundamentally changed the Soviet system and opened the way, in theory at least, to multi-party democracy.** A month later, after the changes had been ratified by the Congress of People’s Deputies, Anatoly Sobchak, whom Putin was following, as he put it, ‘with great interest’, was nominated by the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies as its candidate to succeed Gorbachev as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the Congress’s Executive Committee, when the latter became Head of State...Sobchak was a free spirit, who tended to go his own way...Gorbachev’s candidate, Anatoly Lukyanov – a choice which Gorbachev would later bitterly regret...Lensoviet.."*
- *"...but he also understood that he needed competent people who could guide him through the maze of Soviet bureaucracy. As Putin would put it later, **‘he needed [people] who knew which buttons to push to get things done’**...He had earlier asked Oleg Kalugin, the former deputy head of the Leningrad Directorate, to recommend to him a retired KGB officer who might be suitable. Kalugin had suggested two names, but Sobchak thought they were both too high-powered.41 He wanted someone who would carry out his instructions without question and answer only to him. **Putin fitted the bill perfectly. Mindful of his liberal credentials, Sobchak had no wish to let it be known that he had deliberately recruited a KGB officer as one of his principal advisers. Putin was equally keen to avoid any suggestion that he had joined Sobchak’s team on the KGB’s instructions.**."*
- *"...Aleksandr Nevzorov presented a television show called ‘600 Seconds’, which specialised in exposés of official misdeeds and was wildly popular all over Russia..."*
- *"**When he had returned from Dresden in February, the Soviet Union was still a one-party state. In April, that already seemed another age. That month, he had watched tens of thousands of people gathering for protest rallies in front of the Winter Palace, the first to have been permitted since 1917. Newspapers began to discuss previously forbidden topics: the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family at Yekaterinburg in 1918; the murder of the Leningrad leader, Sergei Kirov, on Stalin’s orders in 1934, preceding the Great Purge; the assassination of Trotsky in 1940; and the massacre of 22,000 Polish officers at Katyn by the NKVD the same year.** In June, within days of Putin agreeing to work for Sobchak, the authority of his new patron was being challenged, an experience which he found ‘very unpleasant’. Two months later, the same deputies who had begged Sobchak to become their Chairman were attempting to have him dismissed. **To anyone who had grown up with the soporific predictability of Brezhnev-era Soviet politics, it was bewildering and a little frightening.**."*
- *"...He spent the spring and early summer keeping his head down and observing what was happening around him. There was no way of telling what the next few months might bring or even whether Sobchak would be able to remain in power. As he put it later, ‘It was risky to tie my future to his. Everything might unravel at a moment’s notice.’ At one point, he started exploring other options. Galina Starovoitova, an anthropologist and leading member of the Inter-Regional Group, who was almost as prominent as Sobchak in the Leningrad democratic movement, decided to stand for the newly created Russian Congress of People’s Deputies, representing the Sestroretsk–Zelenogorsk constituency. Putin introduced himself and offered to act as her chauffeur during her campaign. According to her parliamentary assistant, Ruslan Linkov, for ten days in late May or early June, at about the same time that he was introduced to Sobchak, he drove her to campaign meetings...Putin did not finally commit to working for Sobchak until October, when it became clear that the Lensoviet Chairman had weathered the storm. **Dmitry Medvedev**, another of Sobchak’s former students, who was serving as a part-time adviser dealing with legal affairs and relations with the Lensoviet deputies, remembered Sobchak introducing them."*
- *"To outward appearances, Putin was a minion who carried Sobchak’s briefcase and remained discreetly in his shadow, never putting himself forward. But, behind the scenes, Pavlov said, ‘he took over personnel matters, issues relating to production, the reception and despatch of documents. It became like a puppet theatre.’ Over time, that would indeed happen, but it did not occur all at once. At the end of 1990 and in the first half of 1991, Putin was still feeling his way. Nevertheless, before the year was up, Pavlov already found Putin’s methods sufficiently different from his own that he decided that he could not work with him any longer. **‘I didn’t want – in fact I refused – to work in the system which Putin had set up. In terms of humanitarian ideas, ideas of justice, how to build up society and the state, my way was closer to Sobchak’s ideas. But my system was weaker, it didn’t have any people with epaulettes, there weren’t any armed men … I was someone who could empathise, who could be close to people. Putin was the opposite. We had different paths.'**."*
-  *"...**The only person he seems to have trusted completely was Dmitry Medvedev**..."*
-  *"..The city on the Neva – Northern Palmyra, as its inhabitants called it, after the great cultural centre of the ancient world in Syria – still saw itself as Russia’s northern capital, as it had been before 1917."*
-  *"**For months, the Soviet Union had been threatening to break apart. But it was one thing to read about agitation far away in the Caucasus, quite another for Putin to find that it was happening on his own doorstep. In the event, the tipping point came not in Estonia but in Lithuania, the southernmost Baltic republic, which Gorbachev had been pressuring to rescind what he called ‘unconstitutional acts’, meaning moves towards independence. After the Lithuanians refused to back down, in the early hours of Sunday, January 13, 1991, Soviet special forces stormed the television tower in the capital, Vilnius, scattering crowds of demonstrators who had gathered to defend it, killing 14 and wounding 160. The bloodshed provoked a crisis. Yeltsin flew to Tallinn, where, in the parliament building, ringed with barricades and defended by volunteers armed with shotguns and hunting rifles, he issued a joint statement with the Presidents of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, ‘resolutely condemning acts of armed violence against the independence of “the Baltic States’. Leningrad, but not Moscow, television broadcast film of the attack, showing black-uniformed officers from the Soviet Interior Ministry bludgeoning demonstrators with rifle butts. Gorbachev waffled, claiming that what had happened was not his doing and that the military had staged a provocation to discredit him. No one in the Baltic republics, or in Leningrad, believed him. The Lensoviet met in emergency session to pass resolutions condemning his actions and, the following Sunday, thousands gathered for a protest demonstration on the square in front of the Winter Palace.**."*
-  *"**Gorbachev’s popularity had been waning ever since perestroika began. The more he was lionised abroad, the more he was detested at home. The previous twelve months had been his annus horribilis, the year when everything started to go wrong. On May Day, 1990, he had been booed by demonstrators in Red Square. In July, Yeltsin had resigned spectacularly from the Communist Party. Sobchak and the Chairman of the Moscow City Council, Gavriil Popov, had followed suit. During the autumn, Gorbachev embraced and then abandoned an ambitious programme of market reform, the so-called ‘500 Days’ project. Finally, in December, his close ally, the Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, announced that he, too, was resigning, warning melodramatically: ‘A dictatorship is coming … No one knows what kind of dictatorship or who will be the dictator. [But] let this be my protest.’ Until the Vilnius incident, Gorbachev had managed to hold off what was termed the ‘Prague scenario’, whereby agitation for freedom would be crushed by Soviet tanks. That was what had happened in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and it was what the hardliners in the Politburo and the military wanted.**"*
-  *"**After January 1991, Putin concluded that Gorbachev was ‘politically exhausted’. Two months later, Yeltsin engineered a constitutional change enabling him to be elected Russia’s President by popular vote, giving him a legitimacy which Gorbachev did not have. Shortly afterwards the Soviet leader made another fateful concession: the USSR would be replaced by a new, voluntary ‘Union of Sovereign States’, comprising Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and the five Central Asian republics. The Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova refused to take part, but Gorbachev had recognised by then that they were going to become independent anyway and there was nothing he could do to stop them. Although “no one would yet say so publicly, the Soviet Union’s future was already hanging by a thread.**."*
-  *"**Leningrad voters had to decide a second, much more contentious issue: whether the city should return to its pre-revolutionary name, St Petersburg. Sobchak had initially opposed the idea, as had Gorbachev, on the grounds that Leningrad was associated so closely with the heroism and tragedy of the war. Many veterans and their families, Putin among them, felt that changing the city’s name would dishonour the 750,000 men, women and children who had died, as well as the survivors. There were demonstrations and counter-demonstrations. The exiled writer, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, proposed, not very helpfully, Holy Petrograd as an alternative. In the end, nearly 55 per cent voted for St Petersburg, and 42 per cent against. By then Sobchak had changed “his mind and, when the result was announced, sought the credit for the decision.**."*
-  *"...**On the other hand, the path now seemed clear to a new Union Treaty, which would preserve the essence of the Soviet Union, albeit in diminished form.**."*
-  *"..The telephone lines to Gorbachev’s villa in Foros had been cut and he had been reduced to listening to the BBC World Service on an old-fashioned, short-wave radio to get news of what was happening....Sobchak thought afterwards that the coup plotters had assumed that the population would accept Gorbachev’s removal without question and that there would be no more than token opposition. While Yeltsin set about organising the resistance in Moscow, famously climbing onto a tank in front of the White House and denouncing the putsch as ‘a right-wing, reactionary, anti-constitutional coup’, Sobchak took the first flight back to Leningrad, where he arrived in the middle of the afternoon..."*
-  *"**Putin acknowledged later that ‘when the putsch began, I had very complicated feelings. Very difficult!’ On the one hand, like many Russians, he was deeply dismayed by the thought that the Soviet Union might break apart and the State Committee seemed determined to stop that. On the other, he recognised that trying to turn the clock back would solve nothing and in any case was impossible.**...For the first 36 hours, when the key decisions were taken, Putin had been, as he said himself, ‘in the sticks’, completely out of the loop."*.."*
-  *"..Although uncertainty continued until late in the afternoon, the putsch was all but over. It had not been entirely bloodless. In Moscow, on Tuesday night, three young men had been shot and crushed under the treads of an advancing tank. But they were the only victims. In Leningrad, no one died. On Wednesday evening, Gorbachev was released from house arrest at Foros and flown back to Moscow. **Politically his career was over. By trying to placate hardliners and liberals, conservatives and democrats, he had discredited himself in the eyes of both sides.** The Union Treaty was dead. After the putsch, Yeltsin saw no need for it. **What mattered were the rights of the republics: the less power for the federal centre, the better.** In the long battle with Yeltsin for pre-eminence, Gorbachev had lost. ‘A tsar must conduct himself like a tsar,’ he reflected bitterly afterwards. ‘And that, I do not know how to do.’ The Soviet Communist Party was dead, too. After Yeltsin suspended its activities in Russia, Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, called for the Party’s dissolution and decreed that all its property be placed under the control of city councils and republican parliaments.  **The KGB survived, but for a time was severely weakened. On Thursday night, the 20-foot-high bronze statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Cheka, which stood in front of the Lubyanka, was toppled from its pedestal and taken away on a flat-bed truck.**."*
-  *"...**Aleksandr Yakovlev, the theorist of perestroika, thought he was now the most important Soviet politician after Gorbachev and Yeltsin.** ...saw him as a possible successor to Gorbachev if the Union survived. **Putin, as always, remained discreetly in the background.** In these momentous days, which would soon bring seventy years of Soviet history to an ignominious end, his role had been negligible."*
- 📝 *"**The political crisis in August briefly diverted attention from the economic crisis which had Russia by the throat and, equally briefly, made City Hall and the Lensoviet bury their differences as they faced a common enemy in the shape of the State Emergency Committee. As soon as the putsch was over, they both came roaring back. The economic crisis came first. In the 18 months since Putin had returned from Dresden, the decline in Soviet production had accelerated. Rationing of most basic foodstuffs had been imposed, supposedly on a temporary basis, the previous winter, and had not been lifted. In September 1991, Sobchak and Belyaev wrote to Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, expressing ‘extreme concern’ about food supplies. The Soviet distribution system was broken, they told him, and since the Baltic States had declared full independence in August, the Tallinn Process had stalled. St Petersburg, as the city was once again called – the name change having taken effect on September 6 – urgently needed 20,000 tons of butter and 50,000 tons of meat in humanitarian aid.**."*
- 📝 *"**Sobchak was mortified at having to make such a request – a feeling shared by much of the city’s population: an opinion poll found that nearly half thought that asking for help from foreigners was humiliating. But he had little choice. In November he called in the city’s small diplomatic corps for what the British Consul General, Barbara Hay, called ‘a begging bowl meeting’. That month, even bread and potatoes, the ultimate staples in the Russian diet, were in short supply, and there were long queues outside the few bakeries that were open. ‘The food situation is reaching breaking point,’ the French Consul reported. On November 10, the city had less than three days’ supply of meat on the basis of 1.5 kgs (3.3 lbs) per month per inhabitant. The ration of ten eggs per person per month was cut to eight. Old people muttered darkly about a repetition of the blockade winter of 1941. Businessmen warned of ‘a danger zone of potential social explosions where anything could happen’.Sobchak travelled to Britain, France, Germany and Spain to press the city’s case for help. Putin went with him.**."*
- 📝 *"**Eventually a trickle of foreign food aid did start arriving. But it was neither in the quantities nor of the quality that the Russians had hoped for, and, to rub salt in the wound, the donors went to embarrassing lengths to vaunt their often parsimonious contributions. The French insisted that the medical supplies that they sent to St Petersburg be stamped with the French flag, and the words, ‘French humanitarian aid’, in Russian. ‘This will make the French action particularly visible to the population,’ the Foreign Ministry wrote. When the Americans flew in food, mainly military rations from US bases in Germany, it was brought in by a convoy of Soviet army lorries which drove through the city centre, led by the US Consul General, Jack Gosnell, in a car flying the American flag. When Britain sent livestock feed, a British minister demanded to be present when it was unloaded. It was not an edifying spectacle. ‘The Western countries talk a lot more than they actually do in practice,’ Sobchak said glumly. There were unfounded reports that Britain was trying to palm off on Russia unsaleable meat, infected with BSE, popularly known as Mad Cow Disease, and that Germany was sending food which was close to its expiry date. St Petersburg newspaper commentary was uniformly negative.**."*
- 📝 *"**The situation was made worse when Yeltsin and his Finance Minister, Yegor Gaidar, decided that, with a few exceptions such as bread and fuel oil, price controls would be lifted in the New Year as part of what would later be known as ‘shock therapy’. It was an attempt to do in weeks what Gorbachev had failed to do in years – to transform the Soviet planned economy into a free-market system, an endeavour which the American Ambassador, Jack Matlock, described as ‘like trying to convert a submarine into an airplane while keeping it functioning with the same crew throughout’. As soon as the decision became known, supplies of almost everything dried up completely. What farm or factory in its right mind would send goods to the shops when, by waiting a few weeks longer, it could sell them for ten times more?**."*
- 📝 *"**In this grim situation, Sobchak asked Putin in December 1991 to organise what amounted to an elaborate barter deal, whereby raw materials, including oil, timber and precious metals, would be exported to Western Europe and the proceeds used to purchase food for the population. Barter trade had helped keep the wheels of the Soviet economy turning for decades. In theory, the central planners took care of everything. In practice, there were always holes in the supply chain. All large state enterprises employed fixers, known as tolkachi, literally ‘pushers’, to barter excess production for raw materials which the planners had failed to allocate. Never having known any other method, officials at the St Petersburg City Hall had started earlier that year trying to use the same approach with potential foreign partners.**."*
- 📝 *"**Putin’s mission was more ambitious and potentially more realistic. Instead of a direct barter arrangement, intermediaries would be used. In normal times, that would have been impossible. Foreign trade was the prerogative of the Soviet government in Moscow. But these were not normal times. The Soviet Union was falling apart. The Baltic States, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova had already left. On December 1, Ukrainians voted for independence, effectively sounding the death knell of the Union State. A week later, Yeltsin and the leaders of Belarus and Ukraine met at a hunting lodge in the Belovezha Forest, near the Belarusian–Polish border, to sign an agreement creating the Commonwealth of Independent States, a voluntary association which would eventually bring together most, though not all, of the former Soviet republics. It was tantamount to a declaration that “the USSR had ceased to exist. For Yeltsin, it was a godsend: if the Soviet Union was no more, his rival would no longer have a country to preside over and his career would come to an end. Gorbachev bowed to the reality on December 25 and announced his resignation as Soviet President. The Hammer and Sickle flag flying over the Kremlin was lowered for the last time and the Russian tricolour raised in its place.**"*
- 📝 *"**In these circumstances, the usual rules no longer applied. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations told Putin to go ahead on his own, which he did. The trouble was that very little of the promised food imports ever materialised. The licensing agreements between the Foreign Relations Committee (FRC) and the intermediary import–export companies, signed by Putin or his deputy, Aleksandr Anikin, were worth altogether 122 million US dollars. The question that was raised when the food did not arrive, and which has been constantly raised ever since, was, what happened to the money? It is worth examining the charges in detail, for it was later widely believed, both in Russia and in the West, that the episode very nearly brought Putin’s career to an early end.**."*
- 📝 *"**But appearances can be misleading. It was true that the agreements were drafted so sloppily that a high-school student could have done better, and Anikin was eventually fired for having approved them. But no one in St Petersburg had ever written a foreign trade contract before. For the City Administration, it was unknown territory, as was shown by the earlier failure of even as savvy a businessman as Georgy Khizha to set up successful barter deals. To complicate matters further, there was no established legal framework. That winter, as the Soviet Union collapsed and the new state of Russia emerged from the wreckage, no one knew for certain which laws applied. Russian laws, when they existed, and Soviet laws, when they were still in force, were frequently in conflict. Officials made it up as they went along.**."*
- 📝 *"**Large state companies were wary of engaging directly in transactions for which the legal basis was unclear, so Putin turned to friends, or friends of friends, to set up intermediary companies which could get the contracts fulfilled. That was how things worked in Russia at that time: informal networks were often the only way to get anything done, especially when, as in this case, official channels did not yet exist. In most countries, if a company registered precious metals for export at a tiny fraction of their world market price, it would send up multiple red flags. But Russia in 1992 was not like other countries. Since Soviet times, rare metals had been allocated by central planners, not traded. As there was no domestic market, there was no fixed domestic price. Andrei Illarionov, who later became Putin’s economic adviser, has argued that the very concept of price was alien to Soviet economists: the state plan was based on ‘material balances’ in which price played no part.**."*
- 📝 *"**In any case, enterprises, like individuals, were so desperate for money during that winter that they were prepared to sell anything for whatever they could get. At a time when between 50 and 80 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line, and factories had stopped paying wages, any deal was better than nothing. Russian babushki, the eternal grandmothers who held families together, stood outside metro stations trying to sell bunches of violets or a few poor vegetables. Old men hawked family heirlooms or anything else that might bring in money. A young Western banker was invited to a meeting with a man from the military–industrial complex, who pulled out a piece of paper covered with chemical formulae and said, ‘I’m sure you know what this is.’ It turned out that he was trying to sell enriched uranium. ‘Everything was for sale,’ the banker remembered. ‘You could buy MiG fighters if you wanted.'**."*
- 📝 *"**The real problem, however, lay elsewhere. The agreements that Putin had approved were neither true barter deals nor normal commercial transactions. Once the companies had sold the exported commodities for foreign currency, even if the contracts stipulated penalties for failing to send back food, under Russian law there was no way to enforce them. The entirely foreseeable result, as Putin later acknowledged, was that some of them violated their commitments. One did not: Tamigo, a Russian–German joint venture, sent back two shiploads of cooking oil. But others did as Russian companies usually did at that time if they were lucky enough to obtain export licences: they took advantage of the huge gap between the cost of raw materials in Russia and the selling price abroad, and stashed the profits in Western bank accounts.**."*
- 📝 *"...**'Salye was a very good woman, but she understood absolutely nothing about the economy. So she wrote bullshit. She wrote in her report that Putin and Sobchak sent oil and other things abroad and promised that the money would be used to buy food … But … who owned the oil and the rare metals? Who did they belong to? They belonged to different companies [which] wanted to export. But they couldn’t export without special permission. So they went to Sobchak and Putin, and they said: ‘Get us authorisation. When we have sold the goods, we will bring back food.’ They sold the goods, they got the money, and they didn’t bring in food … Nobody stole anything from anybody! They were their goods, they sold them, and the money they got was theirs.'...There were ‘significant violations’, but no more serious than happened elsewhere in Russia. ‘This kind of thing was very typical at that time – exporting strategic materials in exchange for food, which was then not supplied.'.**."*
- 📝 *"**The chemistry between Yeltsin and Sobchak had never been particularly good. Ever since Sobchak had emerged as a national leader during the putsch, Yeltsin had viewed him as a potential rival. But Sobchak was loyal and that was enough.**."*
- 📝 *"**Years later, when Putin rose to prominence in Moscow, the ‘food scandal’, as it became known, took on a new lease of life. It was claimed that he had come within an inch of being fired, that the amount of money involved was not 100 million but one billion US dollars, and there were veiled suggestions that a large part had ended up in Putin’s and Sobchak’s pockets. None of that was true. Some of the businessmen involved certainly made big profits and certain officials in the Mayor’s Office benefitted. But since the Customs Department had blocked all but the first shipment, the amount of money involved was far smaller than the sums originally reported.**."*
- 📝 *"**The attempted August 1991 putsch made Western governments and financial institutions uncomfortably aware that the gains of perestroika could be rolled back in the blink of an eye if a different kind of government came to power. None of them wanted to pour in money for Gorbachev and still less for Yeltsin. Talk of a Marshall Plan for Russia never got off the ground. In retrospect their reluctance was understandable, although arguably short-sighted. Russia was a black hole, it was said. To give money to a government which lacked the infrastructure to use it constructively would be tantamount to throwing it away. With an election year looming in America, the George H. W. Bush administration was wary of anything that might make it look soft towards its former Cold War adversary. Absent an American lead, Western Europeans sat on their hands. But none of them wanted, either, to see a hard-line communist government in office, and, as the coup attempt had shown, given the right conditions, that could not be ruled out. The answer, they decided, was to try to make the transition to a market economy irreversible as quickly as possible.**."*
- 📝 *"**The numbers of foreign businessmen coming to the city increased exponentially. In 1992, more than 3,000 joint ventures were registered by Putin’s Foreign Relations Committee, ten times more than in 1991. Russia became the new frontier for established Western companies wanting a foothold in what they hoped would be a vast potential market; for young start-ups which had launched businesses in Czechoslovakia, Hungary or Poland, and now sought fresh challenges further east; and for carpet-baggers and hucksters, who came to make a quick killing. St Petersburg, Russia’s traditional gateway to the West, less than two hours’ drive from the Finnish border, had its fair share of all three. For most of them, Putin’s FRC was the first port of call. Sobchak had given him broad authority, and from the outset, Putin saw his role in expansive terms. As well as foreign trade and investment, he was in charge of hotel development and tourism, humanitarian aid, and liaison with foreign consulates in the city. Later he would also be given responsibility for the city’s main airport at Pulkovo; the St Petersburg Oil Port; foreign television broadcasts re-transmitted in St Petersburg; and foreign financial institutions**."*
- 📝 *"**Banking, along with the establishment of the Free Enterprise Zone, was among Sobchak’s fetishes. He had visions of making St Petersburg the financial capital of Russia. Even if some of Putin’s obligations were more notional than real, it was a formidable list of responsibilities. He travelled widely, mainly within Europe but also to countries further afield, including Turkey, the US and Canada. When Sobchak received foreign visitors, Putin was a discreet presence sitting unobtrusively to one side...In October 1991, even before the FRC was properly up and running, he was given a further assignment: to control the gambling business in St Petersburg, including casinos and slot machines, the ‘one-armed bandits’ which were proliferating in the city.**."*
- *"...'Putin’s great weakness is his office, disorganisation reigns and there are papers flying everywhere.' In one sense, that was in character. Putin’s old teacher, Vera Gurevich, used to complain that, as a student, his desk was always a mess, until suddenly it was not and she learnt that he had joined the KGB. But something else was at work, too. Russian bosses usually rule with the knout. That was not Putin’s way. Marina Yentaltseva remembered that the first day he came to the office, she was in the middle of putting on lipstick. She assumed that she would be fired on the spot. Instead, he pretended not to notice. It was un-Russian, or at least, atypical. She did not know quite what to make of it. Many of Putin’s Russian colleagues, including those who had little time for Sobchak and his administration, regarded him as an impressive operator. Pokrovsky, who later resigned from City Hall in disgust, said that **he had ‘a keen mind, he settles everything quickly and has a professional grasp of things’.** Aleksandr Belyaev, while stating frankly, ‘I don’t like Mr Putin’, acknowledged that **he understands how to cooperate with people, how to use them in his interest’.** Even Valery Pavlov, who, when they worked together, found him **‘closed and secretive, never giving anything away’**, noted that he had quickly brought whole swathes of the administration under his control. Foreigners found him much harder to fathom. **The commonest reaction was not to notice that he was there at all.** Western ambassadors visiting from Moscow would say later, **‘I have absolutely no recollection of him. None whatsoever. I must have shaken hands with him – but absolutely no memory.’** Jaakko Kalela, who served as National Security Adviser to a succession of Finnish presidents, recalled that whenever Putin came with Sobchak to Helsinki, **‘he somehow disappeared into the wallpaper’**."*
- *"...**He looked tired, he didn’t seem in a very good mood, and he said, ‘I saw your presentation. I get it. We don’t need to go through it.’ I was pretty grumpy because I’d worked hard on this, [so] I said, ‘Really! Tell me, what do you get?’ Then he got really annoyed, and he said – ‘I’ll tell you what I get. **We’re new to power. We want to stay in power. Staying in power means providing people with practical benefits from our period in power, which basically means jobs. Jobs require capital. We don’t have any of that just now and foreigners do. So that requires foreigners. And foreigners require tax breaks. So tax breaks mean we stay in power.'** ‘Alright’, Ryan conceded, suitably deflated: ‘I guess you do get it.’ **Putin’s approach, he thought afterwards, was totally pragmatic. The Gillette project went ahead and became one of the more successful joint ventures in the city.**....If Putin looked perpetually tired, it was because he was. Most days he left the dacha early in the morning and did not return until midnight. His workload was crippling. As another young American official put it, **‘he was the man who made the trains run on time for Sobchak'**."*
- *"...These were not techniques which Putin had learnt with the KGB. **Forcing supplicants to wait was an old Russian bureaucratic tactic to assert superiority. Putin kept people waiting, unless there was an imperative reason to be punctual, because he could. Being on time brought no benefit and required effort which he could expend elsewhere**..."*
- *"..But Sedelmayer, an expansive, outgoing man, ten years Putin’s junior, who had come to Russia to sell counter-terrorism equipment and training programmes for the police, **was the rare foreigner who managed to get beyond the unyielding façade, and over the next few years he and Putin developed an unusually warm relationship**. Putin was fascinated by the state-of-the-art equipment which Sedelmayer was bringing in. ...in the early 1990s Sedelmayer got closer to Putin than any other Westerner, although even he found there were limits: **'He was curious and of course, observant … And he was always in control, both of himself and the situation … He’d project himself differently to different people. He was chameleon-like. He’d give them back a mirror image of what he thought they’d like to see. He was … good at eliciting information from people, but reserved when talking about others … He was not a person who opened up. [He kept] his private life private … He continually kept a wall between people he knew and his family. [He] never talked about his parents, he never talked about his wife … I can’t remember a single occasion when I had the feeling he was telling me anything revealing about his personal past.**."*
- *"...Von Puttkamer also found that **Putin preferred to talk of practical things, never anything personal. There was ‘a door that he never opened’, he recalled. ‘He is not a man to show his inner being.’ Putin was best with small groups, Sedelmayer said, ‘one on one, or one on two or three. He was an individualist, not a team player.**."*
- *"...“here was a simple answer. Along with the plethora of adjectives used by foreigners who tried to describe his character – **‘quiet and nondescript; businesslike and pragmatic; cold, distant, reserved and evasive; calculating, not spontaneous; wily and tough’ – Putin was shy. Most of his close Russian friends did not see it. But outside his own small circle, socialising did not come naturally to him. As Lyudmila put it, ‘he had to work hard to seem at ease with people.’ However, that was only one side of Putin. Just as, when a schoolboy, he had always tried not to stand out, yet at the same time, by small signs, had asserted his difference**..."*
- *"...his relations with Lyudmila were erratic. Like Sobchak, who was famously unfaithful, Putin’s eye was still prone to wander..."*
- *"It was partly luck, partly being in the right place at the right time and partly skilled manoeuvring. **Putin knew how to make himself indispensable, discreetly positioning himself so that if an opening arose, he was the obvious, indeed the only choice to fill it. It was a pattern which would repeat itself often in his career.**"*
- 📝 *"**At the beginning of 1993, a political storm was brewing in Moscow. Yeltsin was at war with the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Congress of People’s Deputies, which had refused to confirm Gaidar, his choice as Prime Minister and, since the previous summer, had systematically blocked his efforts at reform. It had started as an attempt by the opposition to capitalise on public discontent over ‘shock therapy’ but quickly degenerated into a bare-knuckled struggle for power. The Chairman of the Soviet, Ruslan Khasbulatov, an economics professor from Chechnya with a talent for political intrigue, was determined to wrest back from Yeltsin the powers which the Congress had conferred on him in the euphoria of Russian independence in 1991. Yeltsin was just as determined not to give them up. In March, his Vice President, Aleksandr Rutskoi, threw in his lot with Khasbulatov and Yeltsin barely survived an impeachment attempt. Gaidar thought the country was edging towards civil war.**."*
- 📝 *"**On September 21, he proclaimed the dissolution of both the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People’s Deputies and announced new elections for December. The decision, he acknowledged later, was illegal. But there was no choice. The alternative, he told Russians, was ‘the disintegration of the Russian state, [and] chaos in a country which has an enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons’**...Shcherbakov appeared on television and accused both Sobchak and Yeltsin of acting like dictators – the next step, he said, would be civil war."*
- 📝 *"**In Tverskaya Street, a mob commandeered two army trucks and smashed down the doors of the City Hall. Another group of heavily armed men occupied the Television Centre at Ostankino, in the north of the city. It began to look like a repetition of 1917, when a few thousand Bolsheviks had overthrown the Kerensky government, installing a dictatorship which had lasted for 70 years. That night, Gaidar broadcast an emotional appeal to Muscovites to come to the square, outside the Mayor’s Office, ‘to stand together to defend our future and the future of our children, and not to allow our country to be turned once again into an enormous concentration camp for decades to come “As they had during the putsch two years earlier, people responded. By midnight, 20,000 to 30,000 had gathered. Volunteer detachments formed, vowing to defend Yeltsin’s government. In the end, however, it was the army which saved the day.**."*

With the top four floors on fire, groups of deputies and their aides, carrying white flags, walked out and were allowed to go free. Even then, it was not quite over. Armed extremists, who escaped with their weapons through underground passageways, continued to pick off soldiers and civilians seemingly at random. Sniper fire continued all night. Officially 187 people were killed in the conflict and up to a thousand wounded. Unofficial accounts suggested the figure may have been far higher.**."*

In the interview, Putin went out of his way to insist that none of that could be true. He had always worked for the KGB’s ‘elite’ foreign intelligence service, he claimed, and had had ‘no connection with domestic political problems’, an area in which, he told Chas pik, the KGB had behaved ‘monstrously’....The first answer was a lie: he had spent several years working for the Fifth Department."*

That was hyperbole, like his claim that during the putsch, ‘all the ideals, all the goals that I had had when I went to work for the KGB, collapsed.’ Those illusions had been lost much earlier.

He had discussed it with his friend who told him bluntly: ‘You can stop working for this organisation, but its world view and way of thinking will remain stuck in your head.’ But in the end what mattered was that he had found a pragmatic compromise.."*

- 📝 *"**If the frontiers were blurred, it was because, in the Soviet Union, any form of private business was a criminal offence. Every Russian businessman who rose to prominence in the early 1990s, including those who became billionaires, started by trading illegally. There was no other way. Even after Gorbachev allowed the formation of cooperatives, what was lawful and what was not depended on the whim of the local Party leader. In one city, old women were allowed to sell vegetables. In another, they were not. The classic route to riches was to buy jeans, or rock ’n’ roll records, from foreigners studying at Soviet universities, or from tourists or Third World diplomats, and sell them on the black market. With the capital thus accumulated, the bolder of the nascent entrepreneurs moved on to buying and selling computers and electronic equipment, also acquired initially from foreigners or through back-door deals with Soviet factories. Others, with better connections, obtained seed money from the Komsomol or reached under-the-counter agreements with state-owned enterprises. Eventually, cooperatives and, later on, private individuals, were allowed to open bank accounts and to conduct foreign trade directly. Huge fortunes could then be made by playing on the difference between domestic and foreign commodity prices and exchange-rate differentials.**"*
- 📝 *"**Almost all Russian businesses in St Petersburg paid for protection in one form or another, either directly to organised crime groups or to private security companies with links to organised crime. The old Soviet-era underground, founded in the labour camps, with a strict code of conduct ruled by so-called Vory v zakone, ‘Thieves in Law’, who disdained any dealings with the authorities, was forced out by newer, more violent groups – the Chechen mafia and the Malyshev, Kazansky and Tambovsky gangs, 60 per cent of whose members came from boxing and judo clubs. Gangsters used rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank mines and remote-controlled car bombs as well as Kalashnikovs and machine guns. In 1995, the per capita murder rate in St Petersburg exceeded that in New York. In Russia as a whole, it was between two and four times higher than in the United States. The police estimated that 30 to 40 per cent of the killings in St Petersburg were the work of hitmen.**."*
- 📝 *"**The intensity of the gang warfare in St Petersburg, which reached a peak in 1994 and 1995, was the most dramatic manifestation of the breakdown of law and order which accompanied the transition to a market economy, but there were plenty of other signs that society had lost its moorings. Petty crime and street mugging were a daily hazard. Nearly 80 per cent of the adult population said they felt it was dangerous to walk in the streets, and 90 per cent said that the fight against crime should be the administration’s first priority...Prostitution and drug abuse assumed epic proportions. At one high school, one in six of the girls in the senior classes said they wished to work as prostitutes after graduation...With a population of five million, St Petersburg was officially stated to have one million alcoholics and 300,000 drug addicts – no doubt an exaggeration but perhaps not by very much.**.."*

I don’t know what would have happened had I chosen the other route.'..It was a choice not only for businessmen but for officials.

For the most part, this took place at the district level, but it reached up into the Mayor’s Office as well. When the Legislative Assembly attempted to clean up the system, Sobchak was furious. It was far too useful an instrument of patronage for the administration to give up."*
- *"..**In Russia, there is an important difference between an official who takes bribes, and one who accepts a recompense from a businessman he has helped.** According to the St Petersburg historian, Dmitry Travin, it is a distinction which goes back to tsarist times. Many Russian officials, and not just then, but now, too, don’t think that it is wrong to take kickbacks, they think it is just a legitimate return for the help they give to business. It’s a moral question. In seventeenth-century Russia, there were two expressions for bribes: mzdoimstvo [donations] and likhoimstvo [extortion]. Mzdoimstvo was the proper sum of money for the official’s help – it was accepted, and it was not subject to discussion, because officials never lived just on their salary. The expression is no longer used, but the idea [has survived]. It means that you can take your rightful due and that is fine. Likhoimstvo means asking much too much."*
- *"..Putin argued that bribe-taking was unacceptable, but on slightly different grounds. ‘The person who gives a bribe,’ he said, soon after becoming deputy Mayor, ‘always humiliates the person who accepts it. Self-esteem, respect for one’s own worth, is extremely important, in my view.’ **Respect was fundamental for Putin. Whether for himself as a boy in Baskov Lane or for Russia as a great power, the need to be respected was a constant principle all his life.**."*
- *"...**Most of the people who worked with Putin in St Petersburg have since maintained that he did not take bribes, at least not in the sense of likhoimstvo. That is probably true...Putin was one of the few officials in the Mayor’s Office who were clean...Berezovsky was astonished. ‘He was the first bureaucrat who did not take bribes,’ he told, 'Seriously. It made a huge impression on me.'...These anecdotes can be read at several levels. Taken literally, they were the marks of an incorruptible public servant. Yet Putin’s refusal of even a lunch invitation leaves the impression that he was protesting too much. Likewise his refusal to accept Berezovsky’s offer of a car. What Berezovsky had proposed was not a bribe per se, but mzdoimstvo, a ‘donation’ – a distinction which Putin well understood. His reaction seemed rather to stem from distrust. He sensed, probably correctly, that if he accepted anything from the tycoon, he would be making himself vulnerable and it might later be used against him. With people whom he trusted and who he could be sure would be discreet, Putin behaved differently.**..."*
- *"...divided Russian bureaucrats into three categories: 'You had A’s, B’s and C’s. The A’s did not take money … They were chickenshit or it was just not their style. There was a very small group of them. The B’s, who are the largest “group, were generally speaking there for public service, but would have felt like idiots if they didn’t at least create a pension for themselves. So they would do the odd deal to make sure that they had some kind of financial cushion, but they were largely speaking doing government service. The C’s wouldn’t lift a pen without getting paid. And I saw people make the transition. I saw people essentially start out as A minuses, and become B’s. I saw people that were B’s become C’s'...**Putin was a solid ‘B’. He ‘took’, as Yevgeny Vyshenkov put it, as did almost every official in St Petersburg, but as mzdoimstvo – gratuities, not bribes – discreetly and on a modest scale.**.."*
- 📝 *"**It was a world in which all the barriers were fluid, where yesterday’s criminal was tomorrow’s business magnate and a politician today was a criminal tomorrow. Putin understood that mindset.**."*
- *"...**To be surrounded by shady characters is not in itself a crime and, in Putin’s case, it was at a time when, in Russia, the distinction between politicians, businessmen and criminals was almost completely effaced. But it also reflected Putin’s willingness to overlook deviant behaviour when it was in his interests to do so.**.."*
- *"...**gaining a reputation as ‘the most closed figure in the city government'...Most of the other leaders were accessible. ‘Putin was totally different. He would always try to escape the social part of an event. He tried to avoid all contact.’ On the rare occasions when he had to give a news conference, he usually contented himself with a short statement and then left. It was not because he could not hold his own. If cornered, he was capable of talking animatedly and at length about the city’s affairs while saying absolutely nothing that was newsworthy. ‘He spoke extremely well. His diction was marvellous. Most of the leaders at that time mangled their words and spoke ungrammatically. Putin spoke like a member of the Leningrad intelligentsia. He used literary phrases, elegant constructions … But when you read it back, it was like a blank tape.'**.."*
- *"...A normally concerned husband, on learning that his wife had just had a serious car accident, would drop everything and rush off to make sure that she was all right. Putin did not. He knew that she had been badly hurt...Yet he stubbornly carried on with his work. It was not because he did not care. His daughter had also been in the car. But he did not break off the talks to go to her side either. The self-discipline that he had developed in his childhood had become a default position. His response to any untoward event was to suppress his emotions, wearing an impenetrable mask behind which everything was hidden....Occasionally, for no obvious reason, his feelings would creep up on him and take him unawares. Then the mask would drop. **In the winter of 1994, when Yeltsin sent the Russian army, largely made up of untrained conscripts, to Chechnya to try to suppress the separatist rebellion there, Putin, as the deputy Mayor responsible for security affairs, was at the airport when the first body bags started coming back from the front. The German Consul, who also happened to be there, was astonished to see that he was on the verge of tears.**....More typical was his reaction when their sheepdog, Malysh, burrowed beneath the fence of the dacha and was hit by a passing car...For years after, he would not get another dog out of loyalty to Malysh. But he refused to let it show. It was all bottled up inside."*

On the one hand, Lyudmila insisted that Vladimir was ‘exactly the right man for me … I cannot imagine a better one. He doesn’t drink and he doesn’t beat me’ – a remark which astonished her hostess but was evidently something which could not be said of all Russian husbands. On the other hand, Lyudmila, who, like many Russians, was a firm believer in astrology, told her that, ‘unfortunately’, Volodya must have been born under the sign of the Vampire. She was direct and incapable of subterfuge; he was the opposite. At times, Lyudmila said, when she tried to work out what he was thinking, ‘Volodya’s eyes were empty.’ But Lyudmila was not the easiest person either. ‘Anyone who can spend three weeks with that woman deserves a monument,’ Putin grumbled."*
- *"....By writing a tell-all book about Sobchak, Shutov had shown disrespect and disloyalty. **Putin esteemed respect and loyalty above all else.** His relationship with the security services meant it would have been easy for him to arrange for off-duty officers to intervene. When aroused, he did not shy away from threatening violence: his promise to ‘break Berezovsky’s legs’ was an example. Whether or not Sobchak was aware of his intentions, it would not have been out of character for Putin to have decided that Shutov needed to be stopped."*
- *"...Sobchak was not greedy. He did not own a Mercedes or a BMW, any more than Putin did, and he avoided the ostentation associated with the ‘new Russians’. But he loved foreign travel, he liked to live well and he had a succession of mistresses to support. His wife, Lyudmila Narusova, adored designer clothes, which, in Russia, cost as much as they did in the West....None of these things were affordable on Sobchak’s official salary. But it was his apartment, filled with antiques, many of them provided by Ilya Traber, overlooking the Moika River in a fashionable area near the city centre, which would prove his biggest liability.."*
- *"...Sobchak had bent the rules to authorise projects for Renaissance, including the renovation of an apartment block on Ryleyeva Street, in the northern part of the city, so the refurbishment was in fact a disguised kickback. As in the case of the building where Putin lived, on Vasilevsky Island, most of the Ryleyeva Street apartments had been allocated not to those who had waited for years in the housing queue but to officials and their relations. The Legislative Assembly had protested, but since this kind of thing was happening all over Russia in the 1990s, it was not, in itself, a major scandal..."*
- *"...Sobchak had announced the previous spring that he intended to stand again as Mayor, or Governor, as the post would now be called.150 Although he started as clear favourite, there were signs that he would face strong headwinds, many of his own making. His strength was as an orator. But the novelty had worn off...'The first time you heard him speak, it almost brought tears to your eyes. And then the second time, you were like, wow, that’s great, but very similar to the first time. And about the eighth or ninth time, you were thinking, “Give me a break!”’ Like a soufflé which collapses as it cools, there was a lot of hot air and little substance..."*
- *"..Sobchak charmed foreigners. But he had a remarkable ability to put his Russian colleagues’ backs up. The Legislative Assembly deputy, Dmitry Zapolsky, remembered: ‘He was able to do one thing to perfection: he made enemies out of people who would otherwise have been his friends. It took no more than five minutes … He treated everyone without exception as an underperforming student.’....thought it was because ‘he regarded everyone as a rival … even his own allies.’...'We have exchanged the dictatorship of the [Communist Party] for the dictatorship of Sobchak.’...The business community soon concluded that he was ‘a hopeless manager. He makes promises and nothing gets done.'...."*

One family in 25 had what Russians considered a ‘normal’ standard of living; one in a hundred could take a holiday abroad. The rest were either poor, very poor or destitute. To compound the sense of despair, those who did have a little money frequently fell victim to Ponzi schemes...The suicide rate in St Petersburg was among the highest in the world. Tuberculosis, diphtheria and dysentery had reappeared. Average life expectancy in the city had fallen from 72 in 1987 to 64 eight years later. Basic services were collapsing, sometimes literally..."*

Privatisation was widely seen as a gigantic swindle, like ‘a drunkard in the street selling off his belongings for a pittance’....**had argued that it did not matter who bought privatised enterprises, they would eventually end up in the right hands – a proposition known as the Coase theorem.** **To that end, every Russian citizen was issued a privatisation voucher with a nominal value of 10,000 roubles. If the idea was to make Russia a nation of shareholders, it was a spectacular failure. Inflation eroded the vouchers’ value and most people sold them, for the equivalent of a bottle of vodka or less, to touts acting on behalf of factory directors or ‘new Russian’ businessmen. Putin said afterwards that he could not remember what he had bought with his voucher but it was surely ‘something stupid’. That was true of many others. The result was asset-stripping, surging inequality and the emergence of a small group of billionaire entrepreneurs. Chubais maintained later that there had been no alternative. Unlike in Eastern Europe, where communism had taken root only after World War II and elements of a market system had survived, in Russia, except among the criminal fraternity, every entrepreneurial instinct had been extirpated by 70 years of Bolshevik rule. Whether or not the reforms could have been conducted differently is beside the point. That was the way they were carried out and, in the mid 1990s, they were desperately unpopular.**.."*
- *"...A year later, the rift widened when **Sobchak denounced as ‘insane’ Yeltsin’s decision to send the army to Chechnya. It was ‘a means of covering up the incompetence of the political, military and special services, … another outrage to the long-suffering Chechen people … and a threat to human rights everywhere in Russia.’ Many Russians agreed.**."*
- *"...But then Sobchak suggested that the Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, would be a better candidate than Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential election. He was not alone in that view. Yeltsin’s popularity was at rock bottom: opinion polls gave him 10 per cent of voting intentions. Russian democrats were horrified by his conduct of the Chechen War. Some felt that it had become morally impossible to support him, whatever the consequences. Yeltsin was drinking heavily..."*

European leaders felt the same. So did the leading Russian business magnates. All, in different ways, did what they could to prevent that happening. Clinton put pressure on the IMF to disburse aid which had been delayed. The French President, Jacques Chirac, provided a secret loan of 1.5 billion US dollars, and Germany 3.5 billion, to be used to pay pension arrears and finance other social needs.1 The businessmen, meeting in February at the World Economic Forum in Davos, agreed to provide Yeltsin with all the media and financial resources they could muster.**..."*

Yakovlev was in shirtsleeves and a tie, but no jacket, giving the appearance of a down-to-earth, practical man who would eschew high-sounding phrases and simply get things done. When he spoke, it was to ram that message home. Yakovlev’s image maker, Aleksandr Yershov, who was in the studio with them, said that ‘after about 20 minutes, I realised we would win.'..."*
- 📝 *"**The 1996 elections were a watershed, both for Putin and for Russia. Had Sobchak won in St Petersburg, Putin would probably have remained at his side and, three and a half years later, Yeltsin would have chosen a different successor. For Russia, the means by which Yeltsin had achieved victory had consequences which were no less far-reaching. In 1993, when Yeltsin had used the army to crush an insurgent but lawfully elected parliament, claiming that he had no choice because Russia was becoming ungovernable, Western governments had supported him, even though employing armed force to suppress political opposition was a flagrant violation of democratic principles. The new constitution, approved later that year, had provided a framework for authoritarian rule, a top-down system of government that would later be called the ‘power vertical’, in which, in theory at least, the President issued instructions and the machinery of state ensured that they were carried out.**."*
- 📝 *"**The 1996 elections took that to a whole new level. To ensure that there would be no return to communist rule, the United States and other Western governments aided Yeltsin’s re-election campaign. In one sense, this was nothing new. Throughout the Cold War, both Russia and the US had tried to influence elections in states belonging to the opposite camp. But this was the first time that the West had tried directly to influence the outcome of voting in Russia itself. The methods employed were for the most part within the bounds of normal inter-state relations: secret loans, accelerated disbursement of IMF assistance, an official visit by President Clinton during the election campaign, and the sending, at the Russian side’s request, of American electoral strategists to advise Yeltsin’s campaign. Nonetheless, a precedent had been created which, 20 years later, would come back to haunt Americans – or should have done, had anyone remembered it.**"*
- 📝 *"**The television channels, ORT and NTV, did not merely support Yeltsin. They blackened his communist opponents with every kind of calumny imaginable. In an era when, in the West, ‘fake news’ has become the rallying cry of scoundrels of every stripe, that may sound quaint. But in Russia in the 1990s, journalists had been trying painfully, if not always successfully, to honour their newfound freedoms. That principled approach received a near-fatal blow in the 1996 election campaign. ‘The age of innocence passed,’ said Vladimir Pozner, one of the country’s leading television journalists. ‘Everything that has happened since had its roots there.’ Aven concurred. ‘It laid down to a large extent the basis of the system which we have today,’ he wrote in 2019. Russia’s departure from what the West considered to be democratic norms did not start with Putin. It began in the 1990s, when America’s friend, Boris Yeltsin, was in power.**."*
- Chapter 7 - The View from the Neva - *"..Sobchak was emotional, Putin said, and ‘liked to be the centre of attention’. He was complicated, unnecessarily blunt, did not care what people thought of him and was careless of the consequences of his actions. Working with Sobchak had taught him not to give hostages to fortune; not needlessly to antagonise others; and, in politics as in life, not to ‘spit against the wind’."*
- 📝 *"..**Putin’s approach to politics was fashioned to a large extent by observing Sobchak’s mistakes. He tried to avoid making enemies. With rare exceptions, he weighed each decision minutely and went ahead only when he had convinced himself that the balance of advantage was in his favour. Where possible, he avoided actions which would antagonise public opinion or his core supporters....his convictions about foreign policy – and about the future of Russia – were shaped during the years he spent with Sobchak at Smolny. The seminal event in the lives of most Russians at that time was the break-up of the Soviet Union. Putin was no exception. In a television interview in February 1992, six weeks after the Soviet flag had been lowered at the Kremlin for the last time, he set out his ideas: 'We need to see history as it was, and this [Soviet period] cannot be deleted from our history … [Communism was] harmful because the … attempt to put it into practice in our country caused enormous damage … [That is the root of] the tragedy that we are experiencing today, the tragedy of the collapse of our state … It was precisely those people in October 1917 who laid a time bomb under this edifice, the edifice of a unitary state, which was called Russia. They divided our homeland into separate territories, which previously did not even appear on the map of the globe. They endowed these territories with governments and parliaments. And now we have what we have … At the same time, they destroyed everything that brings together and rallies the peoples of civilised countries, namely they destroyed market relations … they destroyed nascent capitalism. The only thing they had to keep the country within common borders was barbed wire. And as soon as this barbed wire was removed, the country fell apart. I think this is largely the fault of those people [who made the Bolshevik Revolution]. Is that what they wanted? I don’t think so. But objectively, that was the negative role that they played'...The lesson, Putin thought, was that Russia, or what was left of it, must remain united at all costs.**.."*
- *"...**a frozen conflict would begin, similar to that in Transnistria, where the Russian-speaking minority had fought a brief war of secession from Moldova a year earlier and founded an unrecognised independent state with its capital at Tiraspol.**..."*
- *"...The experience started him thinking more deeply about the rest of the post-Soviet space, for which Russian commentators were still trying to come up with an appropriate name. Sankt-Peterburgskie vedomosti had launched a rubric, entitled the ‘Nearer Abroad’; Chas pik referred to the ‘New Abroad’ and then, the ‘Nearest Abroad’, before finally deciding: **‘Other countries have neighbours, Russia has the Near Abroad.’** **The Near Abroad stuck. It covered an area extending from the Baltic States to Central Asia and from Ukraine to the Caspian Sea. Putin knew that the former Soviet empire had been held together by brute force. But he preferred to think of the shared heritage of the post-Soviet states. ‘We are all members of one economic community,’ he said. ‘Historically our peoples have a great deal in common – kinship, cultural links, a common history and common problems.'**."*
- *"...**Ukraine lay at the heart of that shared history. The Russian state traced its origins to Kievan Rus, founded in the ninth century with its capital first in Novgorod, then in Kyiv. In 1991, Ukraine’s insistence on independence precipitated the Soviet Union’s collapse. Afterwards, throughout the 1990s, the flashpoint was Crimea. One bone of contention was the future of the Black Sea fleet, based at Sevastopol. Another was Crimea’s political status, because two thirds of its 2.4 million inhabitants were Russians. ‘Blood can flow there at any moment,’ a Russian newspaper warned in 1992. Crimea, wrote another, risked becoming ‘a hotbed of danger and instability in the heart of Europe’. The territory, a peninsula almost the size of Belgium, jutting out into the Black Sea, had been part of Russia since 1783. It was transferred to Ukraine by Khrushchev in 1954, at a time when neither he nor anyone else imagined that the Soviet Union would ever break up.....When finally the referendum was held, in March 1994, it was ruled illegal by the Ukrainian Supreme Court. As a Russian commentator noted, two fundamental principles were in conflict: the right of peoples to self-determination and the inviolability of post-war frontiers.**"*
- 📝 *"**In the 1990s … the Russians were preoccupied with Ukraine,’ one Western leader reflected, many years later. ‘I don’t think we sufficiently appreciated that at the time.’ To Putin, Ukraine was a case study in the ingratitude of the former Soviet republics. ‘Kiev owes us 4.5 billion US dollars for [subsidised Russian] energy supplies,’ he complained in 1995. ‘And of course, they can’t pay … So why not, from tomorrow, sell [them] energy at world prices? But clearly no one wants that. They all want to get more and pay less. That’s how it is.’ What Russia wanted, Putin said, was ‘a sensible balance of interests’ with the states of the Near Abroad, not some supposed ‘equal partnership’. Russia did not need that. ‘We’ve had those kinds of loud slogans for decades, and we’ve swallowed enough of them … The [former] Soviet republics … were financed by Russia. Now what do we see there? Devastation, crises and wars … And what does Russia get out of it?'...The reference was to the frozen conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which had seceded from Georgia, and Transnistria in Moldova; the stand-off between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh; and the civil war in Tajikistan, where Putin had accompanied Sobchak on a fruitless mediation mission in October 1991. All had erupted during the final years of perestroika and, to Putin, all had their roots in the Bolsheviks’ mistaken nationalities policy back in the 1920s, which had led to the Soviet Union becoming a mosaic of ethnically defined republics and districts.**."*
- 📝 *"**To Putin in the mid 1990s, from his vantage point in St Petersburg, Russian unity was the first priority. The Near Abroad came second. In third place were relations with the West. Like most Russians, Putin initially had mixed feelings about Western investment. The idea of Western companies owning historic buildings in the centre of St Petersburg made him uneasy, he said, until he realised that in many Western cities, prime real estate was owned by foreigners. Western aid, he thought, was acceptable in principle, but he worried that Russia would become a dumping ground for ‘second-rate imports and outdated technology’, which would do nothing for the country’s development**....**Putin, too, remembered how everyone, not only in Russia but also in Eastern Europe, had imagined that the end of the Cold War would bring instant prosperity, but it had turned out to be a mirage**."*
- 📝 *"**What Russia needed most was not aid but ‘a level playing field to work on’. Under those circumstances, foreign investment could play a positive role. ‘We need foreign resources, Western experience, new ecological technology. We don’t need to be afraid of attracting large-scale Western capital. Business is egotistic by its very nature, but [we can] lay down strict legal limits**....**Putin had no illusions about Russia’s ability to sell its products abroad and he did not mince words about their poor quality. ‘We must recognise honestly,’ he said, ‘that we don’t have a single item of popular consumer goods that can compete on the world market. With us, everything is antediluvian, awful, ugly and unfashionable.’ The only way to change that, he argued, was to open up the economy so that local manufacturers would be forced to compete with foreign imports. ‘Otherwise we will just go back to where we started years ago.’ These views qualified Putin as an economic liberal...If he disagreed with Chubais and Gaidar over shock therapy, it was only because he felt it was asking too much of a population already in desperate straits**."*
- 📝 *"**However he was notably less enthusiastic when it came to political democracy. ‘Personally,’ he said, ‘I think that all political forces have the right to express their opinions’ – the word ‘personally’ suggesting that, rather than being a fundamental democratic principle, this was a matter on which other views were also legitimate. As for the division of powers between the executive and the legislature, this was necessary, he said, because it was ‘the most productive way’.**."*
- 📝 *"**To Putin, Russia was a great power and, even in its weakened state, it should be treated as such....because it reflected Putin’s obsession with respect – for Russia, no less than for himself – but of no lasting consequence. Much more important and much less easily finessed was his sense of Russia’s place in the world. Russia, he argued, should not be a buffer zone, ‘a barrier between East and West, [but] first and foremost a connecting link between the two’. The role of the Near Abroad was fundamental. Russia’s influence there would remain dominant. Its neighbours in the post-Soviet space would serve as a go-between, linking Russia with Western Europe and Asia. The European Community was compatible with that vision: there was even talk in the early 1990s, both in Moscow and in some Western European capitals, of Russia eventually becoming a member.**."*
- 📝 *"**NATO was a different matter. It had started well. US Secretary of State James Baker had told Gorbachev in February 1990, in the context of German reunification, that ‘not an inch of NATO’s present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction’. When Gorbachev doubled down and insisted that there should not be ‘any extension of the zone of NATO’, Baker assured him that that would be the case. Although nothing was put in writing, from then on the State Department worked on the basis that there would be no eastward expansion of NATO and so did America’s allies. Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher all reiterated Baker’s assurances at meetings with Soviet leaders. In March 1991, when the Soviet Defence Minister, Marshal Yazov, expressed his concern to Thatcher’s successor, John Major, about possible NATO enlargement, the British Prime Minister assured him that ‘nothing of the sort will happen’. Four months later, the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Wörner, told a Soviet delegation that he opposed NATO enlargement and so did most NATO members.**."*

Moscow was also at first unsure how seriously to take Clinton’s words. It was ‘a hypothetical question’, Yeltsin told an interviewer, but if it happened, ‘it would be seen as damaging to Russia’. Clinton had tried to sweeten the pill, announcing that he was creating a ‘Partnership for Peace’ as a kind of halfway house leading to possible NATO membership. To avoid creating a new dividing line in Europe, he said, all the countries of the post-Soviet space, including Russia, would be welcome to join. Then, in September 1994, he promised Yeltsin that there would be no announcement of the names of the new members to be admitted to NATO, or of the timetable, until after the Russian presidential election two years later, to avoid providing ammunition to Yeltsin’s opponents.**."*

Partly for domestic political reasons – outflanking the Republican Party and gaining electoral support from immigrants from former Soviet-bloc countries – but above all because he had concluded that America’s overriding interest was to lock Eastern and Central Europe firmly into the Western camp, Clinton put NATO enlargement first and Russia’s sensitivities second.

Even at the height of the Cold War, in the 1970s and early 1980s, France and Germany had doubts about America’s willingness to come to their defence in the event of a Soviet invasion if doing so would entail an all-out nuclear conflict. From a European standpoint, such fears were well founded. The United States did not enter World War I until 1917, when it was already clear that Germany was losing, and remained aloof from World War II until it had itself been attacked in December 1941.

But to both sides the symbolism was important. The Eastern Europeans felt protected and the Russians felt the West viewed them as an enemy.**."*
- ❗📝 *"..**In public, at least, Yeltsin did not raise the matter of Baker’s promise and the assurances which other Western leaders had given in the early 1990s, partly because he did not wish to base his case on commitments made to his old rival, Gorbachev, but also because accusing the United States of breaking its word would not make a solution any easier...Putin, following these events from the Mayor’s Office at Smolny, had no such qualms...'He railed against the West and against NATO for breaking its pledge. He was willing to accept European Community membership [for the Eastern and Central Europeans], but NATO was a step too far. We argued that if you have democratically elected governments … and they choose of their own accord to join NATO, you shouldn’t regard it as a hostile act. He wasn’t prepared to accept that at all.'**."*

But on the key issues – NATO, relations with the West, the importance of the Near Abroad, Russia’s role as a bridge between Asia and Europe, and the need for strong, centralised government which would hold the country together – the basic strands of his thinking were already clearly laid down.**."*
- Chapter 8 - "Moscow Rules" - *"...As a consequence of Sobchak’s difficult relations with Yeltsin, Putin had gained a reputation in the Kremlin as the ‘go-to’ person in St Petersburg when problems had to be solved.."*
- *"...Of them all, Putin found it hardest to get used to Moscow. His whole life had revolved around St Petersburg. After the move, he often went back at weekends to see his parents and spend time with friends.31 ‘I wouldn’t say that I didn’t like Moscow,’ he said later. ‘It’s just that I liked Petersburg more.'."*
- *"...**'Putin possesses systematic thinking and penetrates quickly to the heart of the matter.’...‘behind-the-scenes problem-solving, phenomenal flair and extreme caution in making decisions’. ...‘from the very beginning, he stood out among the deputies. He formulated issues brilliantly.’ ....Putin stood out in another way, too. Before leaving St Petersburg, he had made it clear that, when he arrived in Moscow, he intended to be his own man. ‘It’s hard for me to imagine what factions and cliques might exist there’, he said. ‘I’m not going to get involved in any of that. They are bringing me to work, and that is what I am going to do.’ He tried to avoid becoming enmeshed in the intrigues which beset Yeltsin’s court and apparently he succeeded. Lyudmila: ‘He is always trying to smooth out conflicts, and he manages to do it, even when I think he is wrong to try. He doesn’t have any enemies, which is very unusual in Russia.’...Putin showed himself determined in pursuing budgetary abuses and unafraid to offend powerful interests.**..."*
- *"....**The next six months were the most intensive period of economic reform of Yeltsin’s presidency. State expenditures were cut by 20 per cent. Tax collection was sharply increased. Even the state-owned behemoths were unable to escape. The gas monopoly, Gazprom, alone paid 2.4 billion US dollars in back taxes. Almost 2,000 state enterprises were privatised, bringing the treasury another 2.4 billion dollars. Insider auctions were banned and, for the first time, foreign companies were allowed to take part....To the oligarchs, as the leading business magnates were now called, that was going too far. Nine months earlier, Boris Berezovsky had told the Financial Times that he and six other businessmen, who would be dubbed the semibankirshchina, the seven bankers – a play on words on the semiboyarshchina, the seven boyars who ruled Russia after the overthrow of the Tsar in 1610 – effectively controlled the financial and political power of the state. The time had come for him to prove that that was indeed the case**...."*
- *"...**'The stakes were extremely high for Putin. It was at this point that the people in the Kremlin started noticing him … There were a lot of windbags around, who were incapable of carrying out an actual project. And here was Putin – look at the logistics of what he did! He didn’t just declare his loyalty, he did [it] and he succeeded. It was a success … And to be honest, success was pretty rare in the Kremlin then.'**..."*
- *"...**Yet it is difficult to believe that he would willingly have given up a career in public service to move to the private sector when his name was constantly being mentioned in the press as a man destined for higher things. He was a gosudarstvennik, a statist, through and through. He might occasionally wonder aloud about life as a lawyer or a businessman, but in reality, as he said himself, entrepreneurship was ‘not [his] thing at all’. The griping about being bored was a front. He preferred public service and would leave only if he had no choice.**.."*
- *"...**The main priority, however, on which both Kiriyenko and Yeltsin had insisted when he was appointed, was economic security. This covered privatisation and relations with the oligarchs; control of financial flows through private and state-owned banks; and the repatriation of illegally exported capital. The reason soon became clear. Russia was on the verge of financial meltdown. It stemmed from the Asian financial crisis a year earlier, which had led to a sharp fall in the price of oil and gas and non-ferrous metals, then, as now, Russia’s biggest exports. The situation had been made worse by the government’s insistence on maintaining the exchange rate of the rouble, which quickly drained the country’s foreign reserves. In July, the IMF and the World Bank agreed a 22.6-billion-dollar rescue package, designed to support the Russian currency by converting high-interest short-term loans into longer-term Eurobonds. But far from being reassured, money managers took fright. On August 17, 1998, Russia defaulted on domestic debt, announced a moratorium on foreign debt repayments and abandoned the floating peg for the rouble, which over the following month lost two thirds of its dollar value.**."*
- *"...**A solid, well-respected, avuncular character, he quickly won parliamentary approval and over the next eight months showed himself to be the reassuring figure that Russia needed. The devalued rouble, by making imports more expensive, sparked a recovery in domestic manufactures, oil prices rose and sovereign debt was restructured. By the end of the year, instead of collapsing as many had feared, the economy was beginning to rebound. ‘Primakov … had a confident ease about him that was able to quell and subdue the almost panic-stricken people in September and October,’ Yeltsin wrote later. ‘[He] achieved the kind of stable position that no other Russian Prime Minister had been able to achieve before.’**."*
- *"...Soon after becoming FSB Director, Putin was confronted with a scandal involving Chubais’s nemesis, Boris Berezovsky....had given them secret orders to assassinate Berezovsky and several other prominent figures. The story was not implausible. It was an open secret that certain senior FSB officers were in the pay of mafia figures....After Putin’s appointment, Berezovsky took the group’s leader, Aleksandr Litvinenko, to meet him at his office in the Lubyanka and make a full report. Putin heard him out, but the meeting did not go well. He had shown no interest, Litvinenko told his wife afterwards. ‘He was cold and formal.’ It could hardly have been otherwise. Putin despised FSB officers who made their grievances public. But Litvinenko was wrong to think that the new director did not take his complaints seriously. **Putin usually heard out his interlocutors in silence – as did Yeltsin – and decided only later how to respond.**....Shortly afterwards Litvinenko was dismissed from the FSB and arrested. It was the start of a long journey which would eventually lead him to an agonising death in London. Putin had had reservations about Berezovsky ever since their first encounters in St Petersburg. Lyudmila told friends that they regarded the oligarch as ‘Enemy Number One'....'He’s the worst criminal you can think of,’ Putin told him. ‘He’s going to damage Russia and he will damage your country, too.'."*
- *"...**Birthdays in Russia have an importance of which it is difficult for Westerners to conceive.** To attend a birthday party for Berezovsky’s wife at a time when the oligarch was at his most vulnerable would earn his undying support. The ruse succeeded. **Berezovsky was convinced from then on that Putin was a true and loyal friend, and he continued to think so long afterwards, even after they had fallen out.**."*
- *"...The Skuratov affair damaged Primakov, not because he supported the Prosecutor General openly but because Yeltsin suspected complicity between them....The Prime Minister was an intelligent, thoughtful man, but he was also, in the President’s view, an old-school apparatchik, a ‘real dinosaur … hostage to Soviet stereotypes’,133 as had been shown by his reaction – or the lack of it – when a wave of anti-Semitism, whipped up by ultra-nationalist members of Zhirinovsky’s party in the Duma, had swept over Russia the previous winter....By mid April, 1999, the President had decided that Primakov would have to go."*
- 📝 *"...the Duma, which had been threatening for almost a year to impeach Yeltsin, was finally preparing to put the issue to a vote. **Yeltsin was accused on five counts: responsibility for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; using armed force to disperse the Congress of People’s Deputies during the White House siege in 1993; launching an illegal war in Chechnya; weakening Russian military power by ill-considered budget cuts; and genocide against the peoples of Russia through economic reforms which had caused demographic decline.**."*
- ❗📝 *"...**three days before the Duma was due to vote, the President dismissed Primakov and nominated Stepashin to take his place. Should the impeachment succeed, it would mean that Stepashin rather than Primakov would become acting President pending fresh elections. Yeltsin recognised that it might make the opposition close ranks against him, but he discounted that. ‘A sharp, unexpected, aggressive move always throws your opponent off balance,’ he explained, ‘especially if it is unpredictable and seems absolutely illogical.’ It was a lesson from a master tactician which Putin would take to heart.**."*
- ❗📝 *"**Ever since the 1996 presidential election, Yeltsin had been preoccupied, if not obsessed, with how to safeguard his legacy...The main challenge of his second term would be to find a suitable successor. Yeltsin had initially seen Boris Nemtsov as a possible candidate. During his first term, he had visited Nizhny Novgorod, where Nemtsov was Governor, and had been impressed by his energy...But after persuading him to come to Moscow in the spring of 1997, Yeltsin had been disappointed. Nemtsov, he decided, was like Chubais – ‘a technologist, a manager, a specialist, [not] a national figure capable of consolidating whole segments of society’. Chernomyrdin and Primakov were of another generation, reticent about reform and incapable of leading Russia in the new century that was about to dawn. Kiriyenko’s government had been ‘managerial, technocratic … and had no political backing – no credibility and no influence over the public’. Yeltsin had considered others, too, but had quickly ruled them out. The leader of Yabloko, Grigory Yavlinsky, was ‘a good, strong figure’ but sectarian and too much obliged to his own political faction. Igor Ivanov, the Foreign Minister, was an ally of Primakov.**"*
- ❗📝 *"**That left Vladimir Putin. Yeltsin had begun thinking of Putin as a possible Prime Minister in the summer of 1998, when it had become clear that Kiriyenko was not up to the task. He had thought hard about Putin’s role in Sobchak’s departure. ‘I had mixed feelings [about it],’ he wrote later. ‘Yet I profoundly admired his actions.’ Yumashev was convinced that that episode, more than any other, persuaded Yeltsin that Putin had the stuff to become President. He had already been effectively in charge of Russia’s second city, St Petersburg. After he was given responsibility for the regions, he impressed Yeltsin by the tough, no-nonsense approach he took towards the governors. As FSB chief, he had refused to kowtow to Primakov. He did not ‘allow himself to be manipulated in political games’, Yeltsin wrote, and his ‘very tough remarks condemning political extremism’ had prevented troubles spilling over into the streets after the government’s tepid response to Makashov’s anti-Semitic speeches.**"*
- ❗📝 *"**Yeltsin: 'Putin … had the will and the resolve. I knew he did. But intuition told me that it would be premature to bring Putin into the political ring at that moment [in May, 1999]. He had to appear later … I didn’t want the public to get too used to Putin in those lazy summer months … The surprise factor had to remain intact … I needed someone to serve as a decoy. There was no alternative. This role had to be entrusted to the nice, decent Sergei Stepashin. Of course, I would try to explain to him that the question of the future, of the presidential elections, was still open. And he, too, would have a chance to show himself.'**....**But those lines were written a year later, when the drama had already played out. At the time, it was not as clear-cut. Yeltsin felt that Putin would make a strong candidate. But that did not mean that he had taken a final decision.....When Stepashin was appointed, the intention was still to hold the presidential elections as planned in June 2000. He had a full year to prove himself. Had he done so, Yeltsin might have made Stepashin, rather than Putin, his preferred successor.**."*
- ❗📝 *"...**There was another consideration, too. Yeltsin had won re-election in 1996 thanks to the support of the oligarchs. They had now become too powerful...Berezovsky, in particular, was a thorn in Yeltsin’s side. He was ‘sick and tired of even the mention of Berezovsky’s name’, he wrote. ‘But I always tried to keep him on my team … We are at times compelled to use people for whom we don’t have particularly warm feelings. [He] was unquestionably an ally. But he was a difficult ally.'**....**The only group in Russia capable of cutting the oligarchs down to size were the siloviki, the men – and, in Russia, they were all men – in senior posts in the ‘power ministries'...Yeltsin framed the recourse to the siloviki not as an attempt to curb the oligarchs but as a response to a changing mood in society. In fact, the two were linked. ‘For some time,’ Yeltsin wrote, ‘I had been sensing the need for a new quality in the state, for a steel backbone that would strengthen the whole government. We needed a person who was intellectual, democratic, [but also] firm in the military manner.'...Putin, Yeltsin thought, answered that description.**"*
- ❗📝 *"...**For the Yeltsin administration, the key issues remained what they had been in Soviet times: relations with the United States and the role of NATO. When Putin had arrived in Moscow in the autumn of 1996, it was already clear that NATO was determined to take in new members from Eastern and Central Europe, but as yet there had been no public announcement. The following March, Yeltsin met President Clinton in Helsinki and warned again that enlargement risked leading to renewed East–West confrontation. The Americans responded by offering to make Russia a full member of the Group of Seven, which would then become the G8. Other cosmetic gestures followed and in May 1997, Yeltsin travelled to Paris to sign what was known as ‘The Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation’, setting up a formal structure for consultations. But it was acquiescence in the face of force majeure, and when, in July, NATO officially extended membership invitations to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, Russian opposition was undimmed.**.."*
- ❗📝 *"...**Putin at that time echoed the official Russian position that NATO posed ‘no direct strategic threat to Russia’. But he added that the government should seize the opportunity to modernise the armed forces, focusing in particular on research and development.161 The implication was that he did not think NATO would necessarily remain non-threatening for ever.**."*
- ❗📝 *"...**In March 1999, when he took charge of the Security Council, the situation evolved further. That month, the three former Warsaw Pact states became NATO members, bringing the American-led alliance to the border, if not of the Russian mainland, at least of the enclave of Kaliningrad. At the same time, the war in Yugoslavia, that had seemed on the way to resolution with the signing of the Dayton accords which ended the conflict in Bosnia, suddenly entered a more dangerous phase. Kosovo, a semi-autonomous region of southern Serbia, bordering Albania and with a majority Albanian population, became the new flashpoint. Armed clashes had broken out the previous year between the Serbian army and Kosovar insurgents demanding independence. Both sides committed atrocities but the Serbs engaged in systematic rape and pillage. Western sympathies were with the Kosovars, of whom a quarter of a million, nearly a sixth of the population, had fled their homes to escape the depredations of the Serbian soldiery. Peace talks at Rambouillet, outside Paris, broke down on March 18 when the Russians and Yugoslavs rejected a proposal to send in a NATO peacekeeping contingent. Six days later, without UN authorisation, NATO forces began airstrikes against Serbian army positions, including targets in Belgrade and other Yugoslav cities, to try to force the Serbian troops to withdraw.**.."*
- ❗📝 *"...**Up till then, Yeltsin had offered cautious support to the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milošević, but had avoided doing anything which might cause Russia to be dragged into the conflict. The United States had been equally wary. The bombing raids changed that. To Russians, the Serbs were fellow Slavs who, all through history, had been their allies. Moscow was outraged at what was seen as Western aggression, all the more humiliating because it was powerless to intervene.**.."*
- ❗📝 *"...**Two and a half months later, Yeltsin succeeded in brokering a compromise. The airstrikes would be suspended; Serbian forces would withdraw; and a 30,000-man peacekeeping force of NATO and Russian troops would be deployed to Kosovo under UN auspices. But the most dangerous moment was still to come. The Russian General Staff was incensed that the Americans seemed to be taking Moscow’s cooperation for granted. Instead of waiting to start moving in simultaneously with NATO forces on the morning of June 12, as had been agreed, they had despatched a column of 30 armoured vehicles the previous evening to secure the country’s one airport, outside the capital, Priština. When the NATO contingent arrived, it found the airport already in Russian hands...Putin had authorised the Russian operation**..."*
- ❗📝 *"...**His account is plausible. General Mike Jackson, the British Commander of the NATO force, wrote afterwards: ‘[It] was a reminder that the Russians were still players on the world stage, that they still needed to be treated with respect.’ Those were precisely Putin’s feelings. It was the kind of gesture that both he and Yeltsin favoured – an unpredictable move which would take the adversary by surprise – but hedged with a certain caution. Putin had made clear to Kvashnin that it was up to him to take the final decision. Gleb Pavlovsky, who worked with Putin for 12 years, saw that as one of the hallmarks of his style of governance. As a general rule, Pavlovsky said, ‘he doesn’t like to answer in a definite way … He can give an emotional impression; he can show the direction. But not be definite. That way, his own responsibility is not engaged. It’s your fault for understanding it like that.'.**..."*

He …radiated executive competence, the ability to get things done.’ There were no histrionics or bombast, but rather ‘a menacing, or at least, a commanding, undertone; softness with a hard edge'**..."*
- ❗📝 *"...**The critical point came the following day, when the American Supreme Commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, ordered the runways at Priština blocked to prevent the Russians resupplying their soldiers, raising the prospect of a direct clash between Russian and NATO forces. ‘Sir, I’m not going to start World War III for you,’ Jackson famously replied. Clark backed off and a compromise was eventually found: the Russians would play a supporting role in Kosovo, much as they had in Bosnia under the Dayton accords. When Putin next saw Talbott, he explained glibly that there were hawks and doves in Russia, as in the United States, and that the hawks had been behind the pre-emptive sprint to Priština. But there had been no loss of life and at least no one could now call Yeltsin a NATO puppet.**..."*
- ❗📝 *"...**Clinton said afterwards that he had never believed that Kosovo would trigger a full-scale nuclear showdown because, unlike Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, Yeltsin had not been testing American resolve. Nonetheless, for 24 hours, the Cuban crisis had been on everyone’s minds. Although the circumstances this time were very different, there was a similar sense that a line had been crossed. Clinton had felt it during a telephone call to Yeltsin the day the airstrikes began. ‘Something pretty basic is broken, and it will take a lot of fixing', he told Talbott afterwards....It would be wrong to focus on NATO enlargement and the Kosovo affair as the origin of all America’s subsequent problems with Russia. But the combination was devastating.**..."*
- ❗📝 *"...**As Moscow saw it, less than three weeks after NATO had admitted its first Eastern European members, it had begun bombarding Serbia, a traditional Russian ally. It was the first sustained combat operation the alliance had conducted since its founding, 50 years before, and it had been undertaken without UN authorisation and in disregard of Yeltsin’s entreaties to find a diplomatic solution. Without the bombing raids, Milošević would no doubt have bludgeoned the Kosovars into submission. But under international law, Kosovo was part of Serbia. To Russia, NATO’s intervention was a crude attempt to modify a post-war European border by armed force. At a time when Russia itself was facing a separatist rebellion in the Caucasus, Yeltsin’s government felt particularly vulnerable. The Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, told his American counterpart, Madeleine Albright: ‘Madeleine, don’t you understand, we have many Kosovos in Russia.'.**..."*
- ❗📝 *"...**Yet the real problem, as Talbott wrote, was that, ‘from the Russian standpoint … the US was acting as though it had the right to impose its view on the world’.

- ❗📝 *"...**Yeltsin had still not decided at that point exactly when to announce Putin’s nomination. But events forced his hand. The situation in Chechnya had been steadily deteriorating. The Chechen President, Aslan Maskhadov, had lost control of the local warlords, the ‘field commanders’, as they were known, who demanded the installation of an Islamic Republic under sharia law. Order had broken down completely. The only gainful activities were the embezzlement of government funds, kidnapping for ransom and dealing in narcotics. In March 1999, Stepashin’s representative in Chechnya, General Gennady Shpigun, had been seized by insurgents at Grozny airport. When the government refused to pay 15 million US dollars for his release, he was killed. Two weeks after his abduction, the market at Vladikavkaz, in neighbouring North Ossetia, was blown up by Chechen terrorists, leaving dozens dead.**.."*
- ❗📝 *"...**That spring, contingency plans were drawn up for the Russian army to occupy the northern third of Chechnya, as far as the Terek River, 15 miles north of the Chechen capital, Grozny. Yeltsin hesitated. The experience of the First Chechen War was not one he wished to repeat. But at the end of “July, he found himself with little choice. Two villages just over the border in neighbouring Dagestan, which had embraced the radical Wahhabi strain of Islam, announced the establishment of a shura, or consultative assembly, independent of the local authorities. When Interior Ministry troops were sent in to restore order, the villagers fought back. 1,400 armed militants, led by Shamil Basayev, the most feared of the Chechen field commanders, gathered at the border, preparing to come to their aid. Basayev may have been tricked into entering Dagestan in order to justify what followed. The Russian General Staff was itching for revenge after its humiliation in the first Chechen War. But whether contrived or not, the resumption of hostilities meant that Yeltsin could no longer delay.**.."*

I have faith in you,’ I said.**."*
- ❗📝 *"...**Next morning, Yeltsin received Putin, Voloshin and Stepashin at his home at Gorki-9.185 The Prime Minister was agitated. He shook hands with the President, but not with any of the others, and when Yeltsin asked him to countersign the decree appointing Putin first deputy Prime Minister, a necessary formality for the transfer of powers, he became flustered and objected. Aksyonenko, the other first deputy, whom Yeltsin had asked to be present so that he could sign in Stepashin’s place if the Prime Minister refused, started to remonstrate with him. Putin stopped him. ‘It’s hard enough for Stepashin,’ he said. ‘Let’s not make it worse.’ Stepashin signed. Shortly afterwards, announcing his departure on television, he described Putin as ‘a decent and worthy man’, but added, unable to hide his bitterness: ‘I wish him good luck, really good luck, because he has everything else.'.**.."*

In his first television interview, a few hours after his appointment, he was asked what he would do if strikers decided to ‘go out and sit on the railway tracks’, as the miners had done during the summer. ‘If they sit?’, he asked, and then answered his own question: ‘They’ll sit in the slammer. Anyone who destabilises the situation will be put away.’ That was not how government ministers usually talked. Asked how he felt, he replied: ‘combative’.**..."*

It was announced that the Chief of the General Staff, General Kvashnin, would in future report to him, not to Yeltsin. So would Nikolai Patrushev, who had succeeded him at the FSB. ‘We are dealing with international terrorist gangs,’ Putin warned. ‘The abscess will remain, [until] our relations with Chechnya are settled.’
The following day, August 16, he was confirmed as Prime Minister by the Duma by a narrow but sufficient margin, as Yumashev had predicted. Two weeks later, it was announced that the first phase of the campaign in Dagestan had been completed. Basayev’s forces had been driven out. The fighting had caused massive destruction of civilian life and property. Nonetheless, it was hailed as a victory. ‘Putin has won his first battle,’ wrote the newspaper, Kommersant. ‘His debut was successful.’ It turned out to be just the prologue.**.."*

It was the first of the so-called apartment bombings which, in the next two weeks, would claim more than 300 lives. Putin had told the troops during a visit to Dagestan a few days earlier: ‘We have no right to allow ourselves to be weak.’ After the Buinaksk explosion, he ordered the three villages razed.**."*
- ❗📝 *"...**Five days later, a second explosion occurred, killing 106 people in Moscow. At first it was thought to have been caused by a gas leak. But on the morning of September 10, it was officially confirmed that it was a terrorist attack. Putin was due to leave that day for a summit meeting of APEC, the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, in Auckland, New Zealand, almost 24 hours’ flying time from Moscow. With Yeltsin’s agreement, he decided that the visit should go ahead. The day after he arrived, he told President Clinton that the apartment bombings were linked to the situation in Dagestan and that he had ‘every reason to believe’ that the perpetrators were from the movement led by Osama bin Laden which had also been attacking US targets. Clinton let the reference to al-Qaeda pass but assured him that ‘so long as you use appropriate means to fight terrorists and separatists, the United States will stand by you.’ As would become clear over the next year, when allegations flew back and forth about the excesses of the Russian military, the word ‘appropriate’ was an important qualification. Yeltsin had originally planned to attend the Auckland summit himself, but a few days earlier had called Clinton to tell him that Putin would go instead, adding, almost as an afterthought, that he would be ‘the next Russian President in the year 2000’**."*
- ❗📝 *"...**The officials listening in at the White House were ‘blindsided’, one of them said later. When Yeltsin had announced Putin’s appointment, he had described him as ‘a person who is able … to consolidate society and … ensure the continuation of reforms in Russia’. But he had not said directly that Putin was the heir apparent. Many in Washington had assumed that he would be just another in the seemingly endless series of prime ministers whom Yeltsin tried out for a few months and then discarded. It gave his meeting with Clinton in New Zealand an entirely different significance. The two men spent more than an hour together. The transcript shows them both probing, trying to get the measure of each other without giving much away.**."*
- ❗📝 *"...**..Nonetheless, the US President came away feeling that the new Russian Prime Minister was ‘very smart and thoughtful’ and had ‘enormous potential’. He appeared flexible on Strategic Arms Reduction, genuinely concerned about nuclear proliferation and the risk of nuclear terrorism, and willing to discuss export limits to Iran so long as there was a level playing field for Russian companies dealing with Tehran. However, it was when the conversation turned to election strategy, a subject close to Clinton’s heart, that the President got the clearest sense of where his interlocutor was coming from. Some of Yeltsin’s actions domestically, Putin told Clinton, might seem hard to understand, but they made sense in a Russian context. Americans needed to remember that ‘Russia does not have an established political system. People don’t read [party] programmes. They look at the faces of the leaders, regardless of party affiliation … Most of the population thinks like that. They are not very sophisticated. That’s the reality we have to deal with.’ Elections were much on Putin’s mind because he would face two in quick succession in the coming months: first, the Duma elections in December and then the presidential election which was to take place the following summer. He had never liked elections – an aversion aggravated by his experience with Sobchak in St Petersburg – and did not try to hide it. Yeltsin had reassured him: ‘You won’t have to run the campaign. The main thing is your will, your confidence, your actions. Everything will depend on that.’ So it turned out. For the Duma elections, Gleb Pavlovsky worked on strategy – a subject in which, he said, Putin showed no interest whatever. They had had a meeting with Voloshin at the end of August, at which Pavlovsky had given a brief explanation of the concept for the campaign. ‘I finished my presentation,’ he remembered, ‘and Putin was silent. He said nothing. So Voloshin asked him: “What’s the matter? Are you against it?” And Putin said, “I’m not against it.” That was all he said. And that’s how we started the campaign.'**.."*
- ❗📝 *"...**Meanwhile Putin cultivated the image of a tough, determined, young leader, valiantly defending the Russian people against cowardly terrorist attacks. After another explosion in Moscow on September 13, which killed 119 people, he denounced those responsible as ‘rabid beasts’. Chechnya had become ‘an enormous terrorist camp’, he warned, where banditry was the normal way of life.**."*
- ❗📝 *"...**For the first few days after the apartment bombings, there was a mood of utter prostration. No one knew what to do … Then Putin said to us. ‘You do as you like. I am going to fight. If I lose, I lose. But I am going to make war …’ I remember the day when he took that position – he simply felt that this was his moment and this was what he had to do … We had hoped that he would distance himself from all that. Because, without exception, all the politicians who have taken on Chechen wars have bitten the dust. It’s a cemetery, a political graveyard. No one comes out of a Chechen war looking good.**."*

His colleagues knew better. It was the language of the streets, which would erupt spontaneously when Putin felt provoked...who had known Putin earlier in St Petersburg, his ‘very distinctive style, a very unusual, literary way of speaking’, totally unlike Yeltsin or any of the Soviet leaders. Yet he could also be crude and vulgar.**."*

Any operations would be carried out in ‘a very measured and careful way’. There would be ‘no frontal assaults. We will patiently and methodically destroy them from the air.’ As late as September 28, he insisted that ‘we are not talking about a ground operation’. Two days later, Russian ground forces crossed the border.....Putin then promised ‘no tank attacks or raids on towns’ and ‘no extreme measures like carpet bombing’, in order to minimise civilian casualties. Soon afterwards, tank attacks and carpet bombing began.**."*

Putin, who had just arrived in Helsinki for an EU–Russia summit, denied that Russian forces were responsible and surmised that it might have been the result of ‘a firefight between rival bandit groups’. That was a bare-faced lie. The missile strikes were part of a systematic campaign to terrorise the civilian population and show that resistance was useless...Putin’s assurances that ‘we are not putting an equals sign between the bandits and the Chechen people’ convinced no one.**."*

On the Chechen side, Maskhadov’s government was no better. Its writ did not run outside Grozny. Elsewhere, local warlords held sway. Chechnya was a failed state, not much different from Somalia except that it was part of Russia. Putin was well aware that in the end there would have to be a political solution, but for that to happen he had to have a partner to negotiate with. In the winter of 1999, there was none...To Putin, the brutality of the war was the price to be paid to prevent still worse tragedies, and those who refused to see that were hypocrites.**."*

On other contentious issues – the presence of Russian troops in Georgia and Transnistria, and the revised treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe which was to be signed in Istanbul later that month – Putin did not give an inch. That was partly because he found Clinton’s arguments on Chechnya unconvincing and partly because, as the US President acknowledged, the conflict was ‘playing well for [Putin] at home’. The newspaper, Izvestia, wrote that week: ‘His tough stance on Chechnya has endeared him to virtually all Russians … The more the West pressures [him], the more attractive he appears to Russian voters.'**."*

Many people, particularly in the provinces, found Putin more attractive than Primakov, a nomenklatura apparatchik, or Luzhkov, who was popular in Moscow but not outside the capital. Five days prior to election day, Yeltsin had summoned Putin to Gorki-9, where he told him that he intended to resign and make him acting President. Putin was taken aback. ‘I’m not ready for that decision,’ he said. ‘You see, it’s a rather difficult destiny … Maybe it would be better if you left at the end of your term.’ But Yeltsin’s mind was made up. Instead of waiting until June 2000, it would be better to resign now, take his opponents by surprise and give Russia a new President for the new millennium. ‘You haven’t answered,’ he pressed Putin. ‘I agree,’ the Prime Minister replied. He did not really have a choice. As he put it: ‘My fate was allowing me to work at the highest level … It would be stupid to say, “No, I’d rather sell sunflower seeds,” or “No, I’m going into private law practice …” So I decided to do it.”**."*

Although the Russians angrily denied it, there was an obvious parallel. But it was one thing for the West to go to war against a small Balkan state like Serbia, quite another to risk war with Russia, a nuclear-armed former superpower which, if it were to begin to disintegrate, would pose unimaginable security concerns. In practice, Western governments went no further than verbal condemnation. Putin was unmoved. ‘Russia has the right to defend itself,’ he said. ‘If we don’t complete this operation, everything will start all over again.'**.*"

Speaking slowly, a few words at a time, his face like a leather mask, he apologised for all that he had failed to do and said that Russia needed ‘new politicians, new faces, new, strong, intelligent and energetic people’: 'We, who have been in power for many years, must go … Many of our hopes were not realised. What we thought was easy has proved painfully difficult. I would like to ask forgiveness from those of you who hoped that we would be able to make a leap in just one go from the grey, stagnant totalitarian past to a bright, prosperous and civilised future. I myself believed in this. But it was not possible … In some respects, I was naïve … I did everything I could.' .... – he turned to Putin, who was standing beside him, looking small and rather awkward, as if daunted by the burden that had fallen on his shoulders, and said quietly: ‘Take care of Russia!’**."*

Communism, he said, had been ‘a blind alley, far away from the mainstream of civilisation’, which had doomed Russia to lag behind the advanced countries. 'Russia’s GNP is ten times smaller than the US and five times smaller than China … Labour productivity and real wages are extremely low … Over 70 per cent of our machinery and equipment is over ten years old … Only five per cent of Russian enterprises are engaged in innovative production.

What was needed was not a state ideology but ‘an organic unification of universal human values with the traditional values of Russia’, first and foremost patriotism and belief in the country’s greatness: 'Russia will not become a second edition of, say, the US or Britain, where liberal values have deep historic traditions. Our state and its institutions and structures have always played an exceptionally important role in the life of the country and its people. For Russians a strong state is not an anomaly to be got rid of. Quite the contrary, it is a source of order and the main driving force of any change. [People] look forward to a certain restoration of the guiding and regulating role of the state … [In Russia], a striving for corporative forms of activity has always prevailed over individualism. Paternalistic sentiments have deep roots … It will take a long time for this habit to die … Russia needs a strong state power … To determine the extent and mechanism of state regulation, we should be guided by the principle: ‘The state must be there as much as is necessary, freedom should be there as much as is required.'**."*

But it was true that, in most of Chechnya, large-scale clashes had ended and, for the first time, Putin started speaking of the possibility of peace talks...The only Chechen leader in whom Putin had even minimal confidence was the Chief Mufti, Akhmad Kadyrov. He had been born in Kazakhstan, where Stalin had exiled the Chechens during World War II. After restrictions on religious freedom were relaxed under Gorbachev, he had studied at a madrasa in Bukhara and afterwards in Tashkent and Amman, returning to Chechnya in 1991 when its then leader, Dzhokhar Dudayev, declared independence...“As Chief Mufti, he had proclaimed a jihad against Russia and fought in the first Chechen War alongside Shamil Basayev. But under Dudayev’s successor, Maskhadov, he had become increasingly concerned by the inroads of Wahhabism and the internationalisation of the conflict and had spoken out publicly against Basayev’s expedition to Dagestan and the insurgency that followed....After their first meeting, Putin had described Kadyrov as ‘not a very easy partner’ but a man who deserved respect. But to commit to any Chechen leader was a gamble and Putin proceeded cautiously. That spring he declared direct presidential rule in Chechnya and appointed Kadyrov head of administration. It was made clear that it was an interim position. There would be no final decision on the territory’s future for another two years.**.."*

The ill-feeling generated by Kosovo and NATO’s bombing campaign in Yugoslavia had not dissipated. NATO enlargement remained a running sore and the Americans seemed determined to develop a National Missile Defense system which Russia feared would undermine strategic arms control...For all these reasons, Putin sought a back-channel to Washington which would remain operational whoever won the US election. The obvious choice, given Britain’s much vaunted ‘special relationship’ with the United States, was the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair.**."*

In practice, full Russian membership was never going to happen. Russian critics pooh-poohed the idea. ‘Russia will not now be able to object to NATO’s further expansion,’ complained Nezavisimaya gazeta. ‘We have lost our trump card.’ The Eastern Europeans were quick to follow. ‘If NATO is not Russia’s enemy,’ said the Latvian Foreign Minister, Indulis Berzins, ‘why shouldn’t the Baltic countries become members?’ The all-important qualification, that Russia could have normal relations with NATO if, and only if, it were treated as an equal partner, was largely ignored.**."*

Attitudes which have become entrenched over decades do not disappear overnight.**."*

First, that, under his leadership, Russia would insist on equal treatment. Second, that it expected ‘full-fledged participation in decision-making’, or, as Tony Blair would say later, to have a seat at the top table. Third, that the legacy of the Cold War would not go away on its own: real efforts would be needed on both sides if it were to be surmounted. For the next twenty years or more, these would be the three key principles driving Russian policy towards the West and, above all, towards the former ‘main adversary’, the United States.**,"*

Ruling Russia and governing a Western country had always been very different things. Yeltsin wrote later that when he decided to nominate Putin as Prime Minister, ‘I wasn’t just offering him a promotion. I wanted to hand him the cap of Monomakh’ – a reference to the fourteenth-century gold filigree crown which had been used at the coronation of Ivan the Terrible and had been part of the regalia of the Russian tsars ever since. Whatever Putin’s own feelings about the pomp and ceremony of the Kremlin, he was part of that tradition. Blair had noticed, when Putin accompanied him to the Mariinsky Theatre for a performance of War and Peace during his visit to St Petersburg, that ‘people fell back as he approached, not in fear … but a little in awe and with reverence. It was a tsar-like moment. I thought: Hmm, their politics really isn’t like ours at all.'**."*

His rise to power had been the unintended but logical consequence of his career in St Petersburg and Moscow. But the realisation that he was no longer merely a candidate for the presidency, but the ruler of a huge, nuclear-armed, almost ungovernable country, emerging from a period of extraordinary social, political and economic turmoil, heavily indebted to its Western creditors and embroiled in a civil war in Chechnya, would have daunted even the boldest spirit.**."*

Towards the end of the discussion, a staff officer came in and handed Putin a note announcing that Russian soldiers had captured an important district centre in Chechnya. Illarionov, who was not a man to mince words, told Putin to his face that what Russia was doing there was a crime: 'For about 15 minutes, we had an interesting exchange. But, as you know, when people have – to put it mildly – slightly different views on a subject, the tone mounts … He did not raise his voice. It was different. His voice became colder and steelier … Like steel, absolutely cold, with icy eyes … We both knew that if we went on – because neither of us would compromise – it would be finished forever.

But a couple of days later, the telephone rang again and the same voice invited him to another meeting with Putin. More discussions followed. Illarionov accompanied Putin on trips to the provinces, where he noticed that the economic ideas which he had been promoting began to crop up in impromptu speeches. After a while, Putin’s speechwriters asked him to meet them and explain his thinking so that they could include it in what they wrote.**"*

But, ten days later, he was invited to yet another meeting to discuss Putin’s future economic programme, and there, for the first time, he had the impression that Putin was testing him. Was he just a windbag full of clever ideas, or did he want to do the hard work of trying to put them into practice? Afterwards, Putin asked him again: ‘Are you sure you don’t want to be my assistant?’ This time, Illarionov said, he agreed. ‘He had outsmarted me.'**
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**The story is all the more striking because, by the time Illarionov related it, he had become one of Putin’s sternest critics. Even allowing that he may at certain points have embellished his account, what came across most starkly was Putin’s refusal to take no for an answer.21 Eighteen months earlier, Illarionov had been right about the default where everyone else had been wrong. Putin wanted him as his adviser and was not going to be deterred by disagreements over Chechnya, Illarionov’s repeated rejection of his overtures – even in front of members of his cabinet – or anything else. Lèse-majesté was secondary; what mattered was achieving his goal.**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**Vitaly Mansky, who was making a documentary about Putin during the election campaign, filmed a similarly contentious discussion with him, in which they repeatedly disagreed on camera. When Mansky continued to hold to his own opinion, Putin said: ‘You can’t persuade everyone, unfortunately … Though it seems to me I’d be able to if I could talk to each one individually. Only that’s impossible.'.....Afterwards he would attempt to do just that with an annual phone-in programme, ‘Direct Line with Vladimir Putin’, often lasting more than four hours, where, in theory, viewers, or those lucky enough to be put through, could ask anything they wished. The first programme, in March 2001, was totally unscripted. Over time, that changed. Questions were filtered....the exercise became more formal and less informative. The same happened with meetings of the Valdai Club, which started as an informal discussion group where Putin would meet small groups of Western scholars for no-holds-barred conversations, only to metamorphose over time into an institutionalised propaganda forum with hundreds of attendees.**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**There was a delicate balance to be struck between Russian tradition, which viewed the President as a modern autocrat, in a direct line from imperial times, and the exigencies of a modern European state, on the cusp of the twenty-first century, which saw itself as a nascent democracy, even if on Russian, rather than Western, terms. Putin was the symbol of that state. At the same time he had to appear approachable to those who formed his electoral base. It was not a unique dilemma: Western royalty also struggled to find a way to reconcile the mystique of monarchy with popular curiosity about their private lives. Putin’s ability to straddle that divide enabled him to end his first year in office with a more than 70 per cent approval rate. Izvestia wrote that autumn that as well as appearing presidential, he had managed to make ordinary Russians feel, ‘he’s just like me’, with the result that ‘changing one’s good opinion of Putin would require changing one’s good opinion of oneself, which is very hard to do.'**."*

Ten years later he told Vitaly Mansky: ‘I won’t interfere in the creative process. You’ll make it the way you see fit … I just want to state my point of view and you decide if you use it or not.'....But that did not make him any less determined to ensure that the national media served as instruments of state power, and that any criticisms they might voice were within limits which the state laid down.**."*

Moreover, in those more innocent times, they were reluctant to believe that the new Russian President was simply lying when he claimed not to have known in advance of Gusinsky’s arrest..The Russian public was largely indifferent. Gusinsky was perceived as an oligarch – a class of person whom most people loathed – who was getting his comeuppance. ‘Putting an oligarch in prison has been an almost universal dream,’ wrote Nezavisimaya gazeta. ‘Why? In order to show that a struggle against corruption has begun in this country.’ Putin emphasised that, too. ‘The accusations levelled [against Gusinsky] were not as a journalist’, he said. ‘He’s a businessman, an entrepreneur.’ It was a useful way to distract attention from concerns about press freedom.**."*

If they did not like the results, they had only themselves to blame. ‘You yourselves have created this situation, to a large extent through political and quasi-political structures which you control. The last thing you should do is blame the mirror.’ There would be no attempt to reverse the results of privatisation, he assured them. They could keep what they had, no matter how it had been obtained. But from now on, they should stay at arm’s length from the state and they would not be permitted to involve themselves in politics. If they followed those rules, law enforcement would keep its distance too.**."*

To Putin, the lack of respect – if not towards himself then towards his position as Head of State – was unforgivable. Aven thought the letter was the point of no return. When they met, Berezovsky made matters worse by telling Putin: ‘If it’s like that, I shall publicly oppose you’, to which the President replied drily: ‘As you like. That’s your affair.'*"*

The oligarch made good on his threat to go into opposition.*."*

And people could not understand why Putin was so remote and distant.'...For a leader who prided himself on being ‘an expert in human relations’, as Putin had told his friend, Roldugin, in St Petersburg, many years earlier, it was a catastrophic misjudgement.

Twenty-three sailors in the rear compartments of the submarine survived for six or seven hours.

When students at Columbia University, during a visit to New York, took issue with him over infringements on freedom of speech in Russia, he shot back: ‘We’ve never had freedom of speech in Russia, so I don’t quite understand what there is to be infringed.’ That was an exaggeration, but not by very much. Even under Yeltsin, when there were fewer constraints than at any time before or since, there were limits which journalists knew they could not or did not dare to transgress. Apart from that brief period in the 1990s, the rest of Russian history, Soviet and tsarist, had been characterised by censorship so rigid as to make the restrictions Putin imposed seem mild....That is not to minimise the backsliding that occurred in Putin’s first term. It marked a significant step back from the free-wheeling anarchy of the early 1990s. But it needs to be seen in context....To many in the West, it seemed that Russia was reverting to its totalitarian past. Yet such words must be used with care. In a totalitarian state, the government exercises total control over what its citizens may say or write or, in extreme cases, even think. Putin’s Russia had become more authoritarian, less pluralistic, than Yeltsin’s. As Voloshin put it, ‘the degree of freedom was smaller … the degree of order, larger’. But there was no comparison with Soviet practice in the 1970s and early ’80s, let alone to a genuinely totalitarian state like China, where the media must follow to the letter the guidelines of the Central Committee’s Propaganda Department about what must as well as what cannot be said.**."*

If he chose not to, it was partly because he recognised that Russian society needed safety valves and partly to reassure his Western partners of his democratic intentions. But more importantly it was because a degree of freedom – a degree which would change over the years and which Putin alone would determine – corresponded to the system he wished to build. The meaning of that enigmatic phrase in the Millennium Declaration, three and a half years earlier – ‘The state must be there as much as is necessary, freedom should be there as much as is required’ – was now clear. In Putin’s view, the truly ‘mass’ media, the national TV channels, had to be in the state’s hands. Other sources of information would be enough to provide the degree of freedom which, in his judgement, Russian society could reasonably be allowed to enjoy.**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**The ultimate goal was to make the Chechens themselves responsible for the territory’s security. To that end, Kadyrov’s position was strengthened and Putin pushed for a greater role for the Chechen police. But there were enormous problems. The republic’s institutions had been destroyed and much of the economy, or what was left of it, was in the hands of criminals....Without peace and security, reconstruction was impossible. And until there was reconstruction, disaffected young men would continue to engage in banditry and smuggling and there would be no peace....Putin might insist till he was blue in the face that it was wrong to blame the Chechens as a nation for the jihad in their republic – ‘Terrorists,’ he said, ‘have neither nationality nor religion’ – but that did not change the behaviour of the troops on the ground...According to one opinion poll, only 20 per cent of Russians thought Putin would succeed in Chechnya – a far cry from the overwhelming approval he had had when the war started.124 It had become a different kind of war, one commentator said, ‘a war that can go on for years, a war that everyone is tired of'.**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**Russia must end the war in Chechnya, they said. Otherwise they would blow up the theatre and everyone in it would die...Putin’s assurance that the top priority was to save the hostages, the endless succession of intermediaries, the message that Kazantsev was on his way to start talks, were a ploy to make the hostage-takers believe that the Kremlin might eventually agree to some of their demands and thus gain time to prepare an assault. Putin had never, for an instant, intended to negotiate. To compromise, he argued, would simply encourage further outrages. What was happening at the Dubrovka Theatre was the consequence of ‘the weakness of the state and the inconsistency of its actions’ in the past – a reference to the events at the hospital in Budyonnovsk in 1995, when Yeltsin had allowed the terrorists to go free to save the lives of the surviving hostages. There would be no repetition of that on Putin’s watch. ‘I want to stress,’ he told the cabinet, ‘that Russia will not enter into any agreement with terrorists and will not yield to any blackmail.’...At 5 a.m. the following day, Russian special forces began pumping a powerful anaesthetic into the theatre’s air-conditioning system. Minutes later, they stormed the building. The hostage-takers were systematically killed, some in shoot-outs but most in cold blood. ‘When a woman is wearing two kilograms of plastic explosives,’ one officer explained, ;there is no other way to disarm her.’ But it also sent a message. ‘The only good signal to terrorists,’ Putin had said after the massacre at Kaspiisk, ‘is a bullet in the head.'.**.*"

Not only had the authorities refused to reveal the nature of the anaesthetic gas, which was a derivative of fentanyl, but there had been a total lack of coordination between the FSB and the rescue services. Almost all those who died could have been saved had medics been on hand immediately after the assault, properly briefed on how to treat them and equipped with breathing tubes to stop them choking to death.**."*

His goal was to show the insurgents – not only their leader, Shamil Basayev, but also the rank and file who served as cannon fodder – that such attacks would achieve nothing. If, in the process, there was collateral damage, that was unfortunate but secondary. ‘We could not save everyone. Please forgive us,’ Putin told the Russian people in a broadcast that night. ‘But we proved that Russia cannot be brought to its knees.’ The terrorists were fighting a losing battle, he said. ‘They must be defeated and they will be defeated … They have no future. We do.'**."*

It was discovered later that a mine had been hidden by building workers, probably months before, inside one of the ferro-concrete supporting pillars.

The key section was quite brief. ‘We showed weakness,’ he said, ‘and the weak get beaten.’ It was the same argument that he had made after Dubrovka. Russia was paying the price for the concessions made to Chechen fighters by Yeltsin’s government in the 1990s, which had made them believe that if they were ruthless enough, Moscow would always buckle and compromise. The root cause of the present troubles, Putin insisted, had been the break-up of the Soviet Union, which had unleashed ethnic tensions previously held in check by what he described as ‘the ruling ideology’ – a notably more euphemistic formulation than he had used ten years earlier, when he had spoken of the country being held together by barbed wire. Those divisions, he went on, were being exploited by international terrorism, which had declared war on Russia.

The day after the siege ended, Putin said it had shown that Russia’s political system required adjustment. ‘Measures must be taken to strengthen the country’s unity.’...To strengthen the ‘executive power vertical’, he told them, governors would no longer be elected but appointed...‘Governors should be professionals,’ Putin had complained that summer, ‘not just people who have a loud voice'...The Duma had until then consisted of 225 members from single-member constituencies and an equal number elected from party lists by proportional representation. Starting from the next election, Putin said, the single-member constituencies would be abolished and all 450 deputies elected from party lists. This would strengthen the role of the national parties, which should become ‘one of the mechanisms ensuring dialogue and cooperation between society and the state’. That was something Putin had been pressing for ever since he had complained to Bill Clinton in 1999 that, in Russia, people voted for personalities, not for programmes or ideas. But his concept of the role that a political party should play was not quite the same as in a Western democracy. In Putin’s scheme of things, a party was a transmission belt – an idea derived from his courses in Marxism–Leninism when he had been a student – which marshalled its supporters behind a political programme within parameters set by the state.192 Abolishing single-member constituencies, which might elect maverick deputies, impervious to party rules, would make parliamentary democracy easier to control.**."*

An import–export cooperative followed, then a bank. Finally, in 1995, Khodorkovsky acquired a 78 per cent stake in Yukos, then the country’s second-largest oil producer, in one of the so-called ‘loans-for-shares’ auctions, in which Yeltsin had pledged state-owned enterprises as collateral for cash advances to plug the budget deficit and pay wages arrears before the 1996 presidential election. Like all the ‘loans-for-shares’ deals, Khodorkovsky’s acquisition was controversial...It was also true, however, that, given the political and economic uncertainties of Russia in the mid 1990s, any investment was a huge gamble.....Yukos prospered because Khodorkovsky, an iron-willed workaholic, reinvested the company’s profits in new technology and infrastructure and hired Western consultants, to reform the management structure and introduce modern accounting practices. Habitual drunkards were fired – an unheard-of measure in the Russian oil business – and production costs were reduced by two thirds...Yukos soon acquired a reputation as a well-run company espousing Western principles of business practice.....a number of businessmen and officials who tried to block Yukos’s expansion in the 1990s ended up dead.

He was concerned, he added, that Russia might get ‘squishy on democracy’, an allusion to the war in Chechnya, which was a major issue for the Democratic Party, ... but he felt Putin had ‘a lot of ability and ambitions for the Russians … He wants to do a good job. He works at it every day. He’s intelligent and disciplined.’ Not only was the American President impressed by the young Russian leader but he wanted him to succeed and fretted about the inequities of the Russian tax system, which discouraged foreign investment, and the country’s declining life expectancy. ‘My gut tells me it could do wonders for his popularity,’ Clinton said, ‘if he could make some progress on healthcare.’ The Russian economy was improving, thanks to rising oil prices and the rouble devaluation in 1998 which had made local manufactures more competitive.**."*
- *"**More irritating, though little was said about it, was the way the United States appeared to think it had a droit de regard over Russia’s Near Abroad. America’s interest, Clinton told Putin, was to see that Russia had ‘good, stable relations with its neighbours’. Russians of all political persuasions found that exasperating. It came across as patronising, reflecting America’s self-image as the undisputed leader of a unipolar world. In response, Putin mentioned casually that he had just visited Cuba, intending it as a delicate reminder that America’s own relations with its neighbours were not always either good or stable. But Clinton did not, or chose not to, notice.**."*
- *"**The one real cloud on the horizon was America’s proposed National Missile Defense system...The downside was that it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which Russia regarded as the foundation of the entire edifice of nuclear arms control that had been painstakingly erected, treaty by treaty, since the first agreements had been signed in Moscow by Brezhnev and Richard Nixon 30 years before....In Moscow’s view, the moment the door was opened to nuclear missile defence, even if in the first instance it was limited to preventing small-scale attacks by rogue actors, there would be no way to stop its further development and the logic of deterrence would collapse...**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**Putin insisted that Russia no longer ‘viewed America as an enemy or even as an opponent. The United States is Russia’s partner.'...On the other hand, Putin started pushing much harder on their points of discord. There were forces in the West, he said, that continued to view Russia as ‘the main geopolitical enemy’. The Warsaw Pact had been dissolved and the Soviet Union no longer existed. ‘But NATO still exists. What for?’ How could Russia feel at ease with NATO expansion, when it was itself excluded? It was a fair question. ‘We all say – I hear it all the time from my [Western] colleagues and the mass media in the West talk about it constantly – we say: 'We don’t want Europe to be divided, we don’t want new borders and barriers, new ‘Berlin Walls’ dividing the continent.' But when NATO expands, the border doesn’t go away. It simply moves closer to Russia.’ NATO liked to claim that it was becoming more of a political than a military organisation, Putin added. ‘But if it’s a political organisation, why did it bomb Yugoslavia?'.**."*

Putin spoke of having established ‘a high level of trust’, and although he later backed away from that phrase, talking instead of ‘an element of trust emerging’, he agreed that they had what he called ‘a good basis on which to start building’. On their personal relationship, Bush was even more fulsome: 'I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialogue. I was able to get a sense of his soul: a man deeply committed to his country and to the best interests of his country.' Condoleezza Rice winced at that: 'We were never able to escape the perception that the President had naively trusted Putin and then been betrayed.'.**."*

Officially the Soviet Union was atheist, but mothers often took their babies surreptitiously to an Orthodox priest. Many of Putin’s KGB colleagues – not to mention the Soviet leaders, including both Gorbachev and Yeltsin – had been baptised as infants. In Gorbachev’s case, it had been done secretly. In Yeltsin’s, the village priest had been so drunk that the future President had nearly drowned after being left unattended in the font.**."*

In a telegram to Bush afterwards, he again expressed Russian solidarity, describing the attacks as an act of barbarism which must not go unpunished...It was a golden opportunity, an unlooked-for chance, Putin thought, to prove to the hardliners in Bush’s entourage that Russia was a genuine ‘partner and friend’ on whom America could rely in its hour of need. That was why he had telephoned the White House even before the dust from the explosions had settled, the first foreign leader to do so, a gesture which Bush appreciated and did not forget, and why, over the following days, he surprised the American President by offering fuller cooperation than anyone in the White House had thought possible. In a statement on Russian television that night, Putin said he wanted the American people to know: ‘We are with you. We share and feel your anguish totally and completely. We support you.’ The message was not only for Americans. It was also to tell the Russian people, the armed forces and the security services, that at least for the purposes of the struggle against terrorism, Russia and the United States would be allies.**."*

It is hard to know whether she believed that or whether it was simply spin. In any case, it was wrong. The United States never produced a credible reason for abrogating the ABM Treaty. Bush claimed that America needed a missile defence system to guard against ‘terrorists who might acquire weapons of mass destruction to be delivered by ballistic missiles’. The Russians found that risible. ‘Neither terrorists nor rogue states have strategic ballistic missiles,’ Putin exclaimed, ‘and they are unlikely ever to get them.’ The truth, as the Russians quickly realised, was that the Pentagon still hoped to develop a missile defence system which, like Star Wars, would protect America from a Russian second strike, making a nuclear war winnable. The United States insisted it had no such intention. That was flat-out dishonest. If, as Clinton had told Blair, America knew that the missile defence system would upset the nuclear balance with China, it followed that further development would upset the balance with Russia. In any case, as Putin kept pointing out, intentions did not matter. What counted was the capability the system would confer. Putin thought the United States was wasting its money. Even if the new missile defence system worked, which was far from certain, it would serve no useful purpose. Russia had more than enough missiles to penetrate American defences and would respond by developing more.**."*

Although Russia remained opposed to NATO enlargement, ‘we might change our position if we didn’t feel sidelined.'...Tony Blair proposed a mechanism to address Russia’s concerns. On certain issues, he suggested, notably the fight against terrorism and nuclear non-proliferation, Russia and the 19 members of NATO, instead of meeting bilaterally as ‘19 plus one’, as had been the case until then, should form a unified ‘Group of 20’, which would have the power to agree joint policies. Putin leapt at the idea. ‘We are ready to go as far as the North Atlantic bloc is ready to go’, he said. ‘If the format of our relationship changes, NATO enlargement will cease to be an issue.'...Unsurprisingly, NATO opted for the more modest variant...It sounded wonderful. ‘Each nation will have one vote,’ Putin jubilated, ‘and all the issues will be resolved without any prior decisions being taken within the bloc.'...Bush: 'For decades, Russia and NATO were adversaries. Those days are gone.’ If Estonia wanted to join NATO, Putin said, ‘Let it do so if it thinks it will be happier that way. I see no tragedy there … The choice of any nation must be respected.' The same applied to Ukraine...How much of this either of them believed is a different matter.**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**In NATO, as Putin knew full well, not every nation had equal weight. The alliance’s worst-kept secret was that the Quad, an unacknowledged, informal group, consisting of the United States, Britain, France and Germany, ‘pre-cooked’ NATO decisions, which the rest then had to endorse. When Condoleezza Rice asked Sergei Ivanov, then Security Council Secretary, how far Russia wanted to go in integration with NATO, he rolled his eyes and told her: ‘Condi, forget it. We’re not going to join an alliance where our vote is the same as a country like Latvia. You needn’t ask me that again.’ For Russia, a closer relationship with NATO made sense only if there was at least an element of joint decision-making. But that was not something the United States could ever bring itself to accept. America’s attitude had not changed since the days when Bush’s father said of the Cold War, ‘We won, they didn’t!’, and Clinton concluded that Yeltsin would just have to ‘eat his spinach’. It was true: Russia did lose the Cold War. But, as Putin ruefully observed, it seemed that the West was determined never to let Russians forget it. 'Russia has changed radically, the West hardly at all,’ he told an interviewer in 2003. ‘Stick-in-the-mud thinking and behaviour are very strong there.’**."*

And they were.'**."
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"**..The result was a growing feeling among the Russian elite that Putin was being played – the Americans were saying all the right things, but when it came to matters of substance, they were bringing nothing to the table. Vladimir Lukin, who had been Yeltsin’s first ambassador to the United States, protested: ‘One sided steps cannot be taken forever … Decisions should go both ways. They should not end just in smiles and encouragement.'..**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"**..Putin held firm. Russia had made ‘a strategic choice’, he said: 'People ask me whether things may go the same way as under Gorbachev. He too sought to mend fences with the West, but it did not go down very well with the population … This is different. Russia today is cooperating with the West not because it wants to be liked or to get something in exchange. We are not standing there with an outstretched hand and we are not begging anyone for anything. The only reason that I pursue this policy is that I believe it fully meets [our] national interests … A rapprochement with the West is not Putin’s policy, it is the policy of Russia.'... There were sound reasons for that. Well over half of Russia’s foreign trade was with Western countries. Russia’s future growth depended on its integration into the world economy, which, in the early 2000s, was still dominated by the United States, the European Union and Japan... And, as Putin constantly emphasised during his first years in power, although Russia was geographically in both Asia and Europe – the national emblem, the double-headed imperial eagle, he noted, faced both East and West – ‘in terms of culture and mentality it is … an inalienable part of Europe.’ Russia’s policy was ‘directed primarily towards Europe and to the formation of a common European space … We rightfully consider ourselves Europeans. The culture of Russia and its essential traditions were formed precisely by European civilisation.’**."*

Others help them. They help, reasoning that Russia, as one of the world’s major nuclear powers, still poses a certain threat to somebody. So that threat must be removed. Terrorism is naturally just an instrument for achieving these aims.'.....It was ‘a replay of the mentality of the Cold War’, he said. He was not accusing Western governments or their leaders of supporting terrorism. ‘I didn’t say it was policy. But … there are certain people who want us to be focused on internal problems, and they pull strings here so that we don’t raise our heads internationally.’ ... ‘Too many people in the West still … look on Russia as they used to look at the Soviet Union, as some wild, frightful, untamed animal … [It’s] like a lion that fell into a trap, and jackals run around and bark, maybe from fear or maybe for joy … They must get rid of the idea that international terrorists can be used against their supposed geopolitical opponents.’ In the West, few understood where all this was coming from. Many assumed that Putin was reacting emotionally to the carnage at Beslan, in the same way that he himself had interpreted the invasion of Iraq as an emotional reaction to 9/11, and that the moment would pass. That was a misreading. Looking back over the four years of his first presidential term, from 2000 to 2004, Putin felt, with some justification, that he had put himself out on a limb to help the United States after the terrorist attacks. Russia had done everything Bush had asked for and more: it had shared intelligence, given the Americans overflight rights and encouraged its allies to provide base facilities. But what had it got in return? The SORT agreement and the NATO–Russia Council were hardly great American concessions.**."*

Whatever Putin might say about the rapprochement with the West being in ‘Russia’s national interests’, it was difficult to argue that any of these developments had been to Russia’s advantage. American officials saw things differently. They focused instead on Russian backsliding over human rights and democracy issues. Putin’s construction of a ‘power vertical’ had made Russia by 2004 a more authoritarian country than four years earlier. But few Russians thought that that was any of America’s business. Even liberals who excoriated Putin’s regime jibbed at heavy-handed foreign criticism. Putin spoke for a wide segment of Russian society when, commenting on American criticisms of the Russian elections, he said: ‘we are none too happy about everything that happens in the United States either. Do you think that the electoral system of the USA is perfect? If America tried to dictate to others how they should behave, treating them, as he put it, as raw recruits in the barracks of a unipolar world, then 'no matter how this dictatorship is packaged in a pretty wrapping of pseudo-democratic phrases’, no one would want to accept it.'**."*

But the Near Abroad had fundamental importance, not just because the countries concerned were Russia’s neighbours, but because, for centuries, most of them had been part of the Russian empire and later the Soviet Union. Like Gorbachev, Putin regarded the break-up of the USSR as a tragedy which could never be undone...‘He who does not regret the destruction of the Soviet Union has no heart, he who wants to see it recreated in its former shape has no brain.’...Yet precisely because of that accumulated history, when, by Putin’s own admission, the Soviet Union had been ‘held together with barbed wire’, the Kremlin’s relations with the Near Abroad were mind-numbingly complicated and difficult to manage. Like siblings in a dysfunctional family, suddenly freed from an abusive parent, they were condemned to go on living alongside each other amid rancours and injustices, rivalries and hatreds, inherited from the past. On one issue or another, almost everyone felt unfairly treated...Putin grumbled that Russia had had to assume the whole of the Soviet Union’s foreign debt, including that incurred by its CIS partners, and more than a decade later was still paying it off. The supply of gas, oil and electric power to Russia’s neighbours at preferential prices, which had irritated him ever since he had been deputy Mayor in St Petersburg, was another sore point, threatening to poison relations with Belarus, Ukraine and Georgia.**."*

After a period of extreme nationalism in the early 1990s, when the country descended into civil war and two Georgian provinces – Abkhazia and South Ossetia – declared de facto independence, a measure of stability returned when Eduard Shevardnadze became President in 1995. But his regime turned out to be repressive, deeply corrupt and either unable or unwilling to prevent Chechen rebels establishing sanctuaries near their common border...The relationship fluctuated between bad and terrible. Occasionally Putin acknowledged that Russia’s problems with Georgia, like those which bedevilled its relations with all the other former Soviet republics, stemmed from Russia’s long history of imperial domination. ‘The blame is not all on Georgia’s side,’ he said. ‘Georgia fears Russia’s imperial ambitions.'...It was in Georgia, in November 2003, that the first of what became known as the ‘colour revolutions’ occurred...Rose Revolution..Mikheil Saakashvili...The Bush administration viewed Georgia as a US bridgehead in the Caucasus, counteracting Russian influence in the region. Under Shevardnadze, America had given Georgia economic aid and a military training programme and had supported the construction of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan oil pipeline, which would reduce the country’s dependence on Russian energy supplies. Georgia, in turn, had sent troops to fight with the coalition in Iraq....On the crucial issue of separatism, he reiterated Russia’s support for Georgia’s territorial integrity. It was up to Tbilisi, he said, to resolve its differences with the breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as with Adjara on the Black Sea coast, the country’s most prosperous region, which had also become largely autonomous. Russia would not interfere, he added, but he hoped that it would be done ‘in such a way that the interests of the [non-Georgian] population in those territories will not be harmed’....But then the Georgian President turned his attention to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, announcing at a military parade in Tbilisi that he intended to end what he called ‘the disintegration of Georgia’ and restore a unified state, the implication being that if negotiations failed, he reserved the right to use force. That led Putin to warn that any attempt to do so would be ‘unproductive, … long and exhausting’. Relations with Georgia were particularly sensitive during Putin’s first years in power because of its proximity to Chechnya.**"*

In public, he insisted that Russia would work with whomever the Ukrainians chose as their President and that any differences between Moscow and Washington were ‘inconsequential, fleeting … things of a tactical nature’.  But other, less guarded comments indicated a much more bitter reaction. Shortly after the Ukrainian Supreme Court’s decision to cancel the second-round results, Putin groused to a small group of Russian journalists that the United States was behaving in Europe the way the colonial powers had in Africa: 'I wouldn’t like Europe to be divided … into first- and second-class citizens, … where first-class citizens are able to live according to stable and democratic laws, while second-class citizens are told by well-intentioned persons in pith helmets what political course to follow. And if the ungrateful natives object, they will be punished by having bombs dropped on their heads, as happened in Belgrade'. That was dishonest. Putin had intervened in the Ukrainian elections far more blatantly than the Americans had. Yanukovych, as even some Russian commentators acknowledged, had been a weak candidate, unable to gain broad support outside his own fiefdoms in Donetsk and Luhansk. But this was not how Putin saw it.

Gerhard Schröder, who had argued that it was wrong ‘to place excessive demands on Russia when it comes to the rate of domestic political reform’, was replaced by Angela Merkel, who had grown up in East Germany and had far fewer illusions about Russia. In Italy, the ebullient Silvio Berlusconi, with whom Putin had developed a warm relationship, sending his daughters to spend holidays with the Prime Minister’s children at the family villa in Sardinia, was succeeded by the cerebral Romano Prodi. In France, Nicolas Sarkozy, an impulsive right-winger who was an unknown quantity in Moscow, took over from Jacques Chirac. Despite the changes, Russia’s relations with the European Union continued to make progress. Areas of cooperation known as 'common spaces’ were established covering economic relations, security and legal affairs, external security and science, education and culture, and there was renewed talk – though only talk – of easing visa requirements.

-  *"...**Bush had promoted Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State, replacing Colin Powell, whom Putin later described as ‘one of the few genuinely very agreeable partners among the US officials we dealt with’. If that sounded like a jab at Rice, it was intended as such. The ‘Iron Magnolia’, as the Russian press dubbed her, had taken up her new post with guns blazing. Shortly before visiting Moscow, in April, she called on Putin not to stand again as President when his second term ended in 2008, and then followed up with an interview with Ekho Moskvy in which she complained that Russia needed more democracy and that Putin had concentrated too much power in his own hands. Democracy, he retorted, ‘is not a commodity that can simply be exported from one country to another … It is a product of society’s internal development.’ Russia had no future without democracy but it had to be governed ‘using methods best suited to its conditions and not in the same way as in some European countries or the United States’. President Bush had some sympathy with that. He would never expect Russia to look like America, he said. Instead, it would have ‘a Russian-style democracy’. The neocons in his entourage, Rice among them, took a different view.**."*

There had been no progress towards a compromise on the US National Missile Defense system and no progress on nuclear disarmament. The days when Putin had called for closer relations with NATO were in the distant past. Now he complained about the alliance’s double standards. On the one hand, the West urged recognition of the independence of Kosovo, which was legally a part of Serbia, threatening the inviolability of Europe’s post-war frontiers. On the other, it closed its eyes when Latvia classed nearly half a million Russian residents as ‘non-citizens’ and denied them political rights.**.."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**It was with the problems of the Russian diaspora in mind – the 25 million Russians who, almost from one day to the next, had found themselves expatriates in newly independent post-Soviet states – that, in an address to the two houses of the Russian parliament in April, Putin asserted that the collapse of the Soviet Union was ‘the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century'..The phrase was unfortunate. It made him look like an unreconstructed Soviet apologist whose aim in life was to restore the USSR as it had been before. In fact, he had already stated on multiple occasions that, while the Soviet period was ‘a complicated page of our history, heroic, constructive yet also tragic, it’s a page that has been turned. That ship has sailed.’ All he had meant by calling it a catastrophe, he maintained later, was that it was a humanitarian disaster.
In fact there was more to it than that. The word ‘geopolitical’ was key. He had inadvertently opened a window onto what he really believed. For Putin, as for most Russians of his generation, the end of the USSR had been an earth-shattering event. Asked many years later what had influenced him most and what he would most like to be able to undo, he replied: ‘The Soviet Union’s collapse’.**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**At the end of 2005, another of the consequences of the Soviet break-up came home to roost. Ukraine still paid for Russian gas supplies by an arcane system of barter. Ever since Putin had been in charge of foreign trade in St Petersburg, he had favoured moving to market relations, under which Ukraine and the other post-Soviet states which benefitted from what had been called ‘friendship prices’, often three or four times lower than those practised elsewhere, would start paying at the same rate as Western Europe. Russia had been for too long ‘a milch-cow for all and sundry’, he said, subsiding oil and gas supplies to the other CIS members to the tune of several billion dollars a year.**.."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**Putin offered Ukraine a loan to cover the difference between the ‘friendship’ and the market price, but emphasised that it would have to be guaranteed by an international bank and eventually reimbursed. Yushchenko refused. Finally, on December 31, Putin suggested a compromise: Russia would continue to supply gas in the first quarter of 2006 at the present price, provided Ukraine agreed to transition to market rates thereafter. Again, Yushchenko refused. Accordingly, on January 1, 2006, Gazprom shut off the supply. Three days later, the Ukrainian President capitulated, an agreement was signed providing for a gradual transition to market prices and supplies resumed. It was not the first time Russia had shut off the gas. Two years earlier, Gazprom had cut supplies to Belarus during a similar dispute. But on that occasion the only other countries affected were Poland and Lithuania. This time, Austria, France and Italy, as well as much of Eastern Europe, found their gas supply cut off.**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**“The effects were twofold. Although European governments had some sympathy for Putin’s position – the Ukrainians were behaving badly; there was no reason at all for them not to pay the market rate – most of the Western news media, which had little interest in the technicalities of long-term gas contracts, saw it as crude Russian bullying. Public opinion, already disenchanted with Putin and his regime, became further disabused. Equally if not more important, the issue of energy security, and the vexed question of whether Europe was becoming too dependent on Russian oil and gas, was put firmly back on the agenda. That had been an American hobby horse ever since the Reagan administration had tried to block the construction of a Russian gas pipeline to Western Europe in the 1980s. But now it took on additional significance because, apart from geopolitical considerations, Washington was seeking European markets for US exports of Liquefied Natural Gas.**."*
- *"...Russia’s energy relations with its former Soviet neighbours are like an awful divorce process. [But] moving to cold hard contracts may mark the end of the heavy-handed use of energy as a political bludgeon, not the beginning, [and] we are all likely to be better off in the end.'."*

Other actions by the Russian government have been counterproductive and could begin to affect relations with other countries. No legitimate interest is served when oil and gas become tools of intimidation or blackmail … Russia has a choice to make … None of us believes that Russia is fated to become an enemy.'...The implication was that if Russia did not change its ways, it would indeed become an enemy. A Western diplomat in Moscow called it ‘the most abrasive speech against Russia’ since Reagan had spoken at the Brandenburg Gate in 1987 and urged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall...Putin’s response: 'The wolf knows who to eat,’ he said. ‘How quickly the pathetic utterances about human rights and democracy are laid aside when one’s own interests come to the fore!’ In plain English, Cheney was a hypocrite and America a predator whose default reaction was not to try to work out differences but to resort to force.**."*

The gas dispute marked the beginning of a profound change in Russia’s attitude both to its neighbours and to the West. The days when Putin would lean over backwards to avoid unnecessarily antagonising the United States and its European allies were long gone. The Russian economy seemed strong. Oil prices were at record highs. The country had paid off its foreign debts, depriving the West of an important source of leverage. Putin’s popularity was consistently above 70 per cent. For the first time, Russia had begun to flex its muscles, demonstrating its newfound power. It had not done so very skilfully. Putin admitted that Russia had explained its case poorly..But he had shown that he was prepared to be tough in defence of what he saw as Russia’s interests, even if it led to problems with the West, and that went down well with Russians.**."*

Russia’s most important partner was the EU and, in his view, its leading members were ‘Germany, France, Italy and Spain’, in that order. Britain, which three years earlier he had described as the key to Russia’s integration with the European economy, no longer even got a mention. Blair’s government was seen as so subservient to the United States that it would never act independently. Whatever happened to Moscow’s relationship with Washington, for better or worse, Putin thought, Britain would follow meekly behind.**."*

Accordingly London spoke gingerly of ‘state involvement’ but did not accuse the Kremlin directly....To Putin that was just another sign of British weakness....But it was prima facie evidence that the decision had been taken by Putin himself. Why did he do it? Litvinenko was a has-been as far as Moscow was concerned....There were other exiles in London whom the Kremlin regarded as a much greater threat....Yet that may have been the point. Litvinenko was not a high-profile opponent. His murder was symbolic and, had the British police not discovered the polonium trail, Moscow would not have suffered any adverse consequences. His killing followed the passage of a new law by the Duma giving the security services increased powers to act against ‘terrorists’ and ‘extremists’ abroad. It was an odd piece of legislation. The Russian special services had never previously required legal authority to murder exiled opponents...But the law and Litvinenko’s murder had the same purpose: they were a warning to Russian expatriates not to get out of line.**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**At the time, the assassination of Litvinenko was seen as essentially a bilateral issue between Russia and Britain. That was a mistake. It had much broader significance. Putin rarely acted without thinking through the possible consequences. He had known that there was a chance – probably a good chance, given the tendency of all secret services to screw up – that Litvinenko’s murder would be traced back to Russia. If he had decided to go ahead, it was not merely because, by the summer of 2006, he had largely given up on Britain, but more importantly because he was beginning to have serious doubts about Russia’s future relationship with America. Ever since Putin had become President, six years earlier, his goal had been to forge a close relationship with the West. Now he was beginning to wonder whether that was even possible.**."*

But this was the first time he had threatened to respond militarily if Saakashvili intervened.**"*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**Whether because of US pressure or because, shortly afterwards, Putin confirmed the withdrawal of the last Russian troops from the old Soviet-era bases in Georgia, or for some other reason, the tensions over South Ossetia temporarily eased. But there were deeper grievances. Ambassador Burns listed them. They included ‘the sense that we didn’t show as much concern for [Putin’s] interests as he did for ours after 9/11 by facilitating Central Asian basing; that we don’t understand how hard for him it has been to restore order in Russia (such as it is) after Yeltsin’s chaos; and that we are fundamentally uncomfortable with Russia’s return as a Great Power and seek to constrain it’. It was ‘not a pretty picture’, Burns thought. The US–Russian relationship was ‘drifting into very rough waters’ which would be difficult to navigate for at least the next 18 months and probably much longer.**"*

As a result we do not have sufficient strength to find a comprehensive solution to any of them. Their political settlement also becomes impossible. We are seeing an ever greater disregard of the fundamental principles of international law … What’s more, individual laws, in fact, virtually the whole legal system, of one particular country, the United States, have transgressed that country’s national boundaries in every sphere – the economy, politics and humanitarian affairs – and have been imposed on other nations. And who likes this? Who likes it?'... Attempts were being made, he said, to impose a unipolar system, in which there would be ‘one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making, … a world in which there is one master, one sovereign’. That was unacceptable and undemocratic. Russia, Putin said, was ‘constantly being lectured about democracy. But for some reason, those who teach us do not want to learn themselves.’ Unipolarity was pernicious ‘not only for those within the system, but also for the sovereign [power] because it destroys itself from within’. In a world where the combined economies of China, India and other rising powers would soon be larger than that of America, it was inevitable that, sooner or later, whether the United States wished it or not, a multipolar system would develop. ... After the Cold War, Putin went on, ideological stereotypes and relics of bloc thinking had been left lying around ‘like live ammunition’. The United States and its allies had transformed the OSCE, which had been established as a multilateral organisation, into ‘a vulgar instrument to promote [their] foreign policy interests’. The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe was in ‘a pitiable state’ as a result of arguments about the presence of Russian troops in Georgia and Transnistria and the United States’ decision to build forward bases in Bulgaria and Romania. The US National Missile Defense system would not only spark a new arms race, which no one in Europe needed, but, should it ever be developed to a point where it could neutralise Russia’s strategic systems, the nuclear “balance which had kept the peace for the previous half-century would be totally destroyed.**."*

In this situation, it is better to be frank.’ The Bush administration had just lost both the Senate and the House to the Democrats in the mid-term elections. Iraq was a mess. Europe was distracted by leadership transitions.

Putin would insist right up to the end of Bush’s presidency that he was ‘a very reliable partner and a decent person’ who was honestly defending what he saw as America’s interests. Bush, too, even if Putin had disappointed him on many issues, continued to describe the Russian leader as a friend, and when he came to write his memoirs some years later, largely abstained from criticising him. Even Condoleezza Rice, not Putin’s greatest admirer, wrote that their relationship helped to ‘calm the waters’. But having good personal relations was one thing, the imperatives of national security were another.

Soviet brinkmanship had caused the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Now, even though Moscow and Washington were no longer adversaries, America was making the same kind of error. ‘I would not say that NATO is the stinking corpse of the Cold War,’ Putin told Time magazine that winter, ‘but it is certainly a holdover from the past.’ He sometimes had the impression, he added, that ‘America does not need friends. It needs vassals it can command. We cannot build our relations with other countries on such principles.'**."*

Nobody will bother to ask your opinion [when decisions are taken] … NATO’s purpose is aimed against the sovereignty of Russia … After joining NATO your sovereignty will be limited, and Georgia, too, will be a threat to Russia.' As the meeting ended, he warned again that NATO membership would be counterproductive at a time when, he said, tensions between Russia and Georgia were easing. ‘You think you can trust the Americans,’ he told Saakashvili. ‘Nobody can be trusted! Except me. I will do what I promise.’ Georgia had not been alone in applying to join NATO’s Membership Action Plan at the beginning of 2008. Ukraine had also done so. France and Germany had immediately objected, arguing that neither country was ready. The prospect of Ukrainian membership worried Putin even more.... ‘Can you imagine Sevastopol [the home port of the Russian Black Sea Fleet] with a NATO base there?’ he asked. ‘Just think of the impact that would have!’ In private, he made clear that any such move would be totally unacceptable.**."*

Why, he asked Bush, was America willing to put at risk its relations with Russia for marginal gains? ‘What is Ukraine?’, he said. ‘Ukraine isn’t even a country. Part of its territory is in Eastern Europe, while the rest was a gift from Russia’. As for Georgia, it was not part of Europe, so what was its place in a Euro-Atlantic alliance? ‘You and I,’ he went on, ‘are the only two people in our respective administrations that want good relations between the United States and Russia.

It had nowhere else to go. The Russian elite did not send their children to study in Beijing or Shanghai. They sent them to British or American schools and universities.

For as long as most Russians could remember, Marxism–Leninism, even if honoured in the breach, had provided a moral framework, which, whether accepted, ignored or resisted, gave meaning to people’s lives. It had been ‘a beautiful song, but a false one’, Putin declared. Now that it had been rejected, the question was, what should replace it? Russia was ‘not a chip off the Soviet block’. It would have different beliefs, a different identity and a different sense of its role in the world...Yeltsin had tried to address this issue after his re-election in 1996. ‘In Russia, we have had various periods: tsarism, totalitarianism, perestroika,’ he told a meeting of his supporters. ‘Each stage had its ideology, its national idea.

Putin did not like ideologies. He was pragmatic...'the only correct approach to politics in general is [to be] neither left nor right, neither pro-Western nor anti.’ What was important was for Russia to have a moral compass and to cherish the achievements of the past. The key elements, he said, were ‘patriotism [and] religious and cultural values – everything that … makes us a people with our own originality, different from others’.

And is there nothing good to remember about the Soviet period? Was there nothing but Stalin’s prison camps and repression? … I cannot agree to this … [Yes,] we can concoct a new anthem, flag and coat of arms. But then we will become a people with no memory of where we came from. The restoration of the old anthem with new words, he said, had ‘finally overcome the disparity between past and present … One cannot be permanently in 'contradiction with one’s own history.’...The idea that Russia should assume its past, while focusing on its achievements rather than its failings, would be a guiding principle throughout Putin’s presidency. ‘Why can’t we, when we listen to the anthem, think about the victory in World War II rather than the Gulag?’, he asked. ‘Why do we have to associate it with the worst aspects of Soviet life?’ There was a political rationale for restoring the old anthem, he admitted, because many Russians felt ‘a certain nostalgia’ for it, and gaining their support would enable him to realise other, more important parts of his agenda. ‘But there is also a moral aspect … You must not deprive people of everything [they value]. I think about this when I remember my parents. This was part of their life. Should we dump it all in the scrap heap of history? As if they hadn’t lived at all?’...For similar reasons, Putin rejected the entreaties of the liberals to remove Lenin’s mummified body from the mausoleum on Red Square....Removing the symbol of that revolution, he said, would mean to many older people that ‘they had worshipped false values … and their lives had been wasted.**."*

But dealing with the conflicts which had set Whites against Reds almost a century before was easier than achieving consensus on more recent history...The touchiest issue was Stalin: murderous tyrant to some, heroic wartime leader to others. For most of his first two terms, Putin tacked first one way, then the other. Stalin, he said, had been ‘greatly to blame for the failures of the first year or year and a half of the war’, refusing to believe warnings that Hitler was preparing to invade. He also bore responsibility for ‘the tragedy of deportation’, when entire nations, mainly in the Caucasus, were uprooted from their homes and exiled to Central Asia, because he feared they might collaborate with the Germans. But those criticisms were offset by the unveiling of a huge bronze plaque in the Kremlin’s Palace of Congresses, glorifying Stalin’s wartime role....When it came to the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, under which, in 1939, Russia and Nazi Germany had agreed to divide up Eastern Europe between them, Putin tried to satisfy both sides. On the one hand, it had been a ‘personal decision by Stalin’, not in the interests of the Soviet people, he declared. On the other, it had been necessary as a response to the Munich agreement, which Britain and France had signed with Hitler the previous year, hoping to sit out the war while Germany and the Soviet Union destroyed each other.  To find a middle course in a debate where passions were even more inflamed than over Lenin was impossible. It was one thing to argue over essentially symbolic issues – quite another when Stalin’s iron rule had affected every Russian family and was seared into every memory.

In the summer of 2007, he finally got round to doing something about it. A teachers’ manual was produced under the watchful eye of Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin ideologist, followed by a textbook for high-school students. The guiding principles were that the history of the tsarist empire, the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia should be treated as a single, continuous whole, and that the positive aspects of Russian history should be emphasised, rather than ‘the black pages’. Putin called it ‘objective and thorough’. Others saw it as a ‘lacquering’ of history. ‘In Russia, only the past is unpredictable’, one commentator wrote wryly, reprising an old Soviet joke. In Putin’s new authorised version, Stalin’s despotism was depicted as having created the necessary conditions for modernising the country’s economy. 'Bolsheviks were able to fulfil this task only by violence,’ the textbook explained. ‘They had no other instruments for modernising Russia, so violence was inevitable.’ It criticised Khrushchev for ‘hare-brained schemes’; praised Brezhnev for having, like Putin, brought stability; accused Gorbachev of having brought about the break-up of the Soviet Union, but also grudgingly gave him credit for, as Putin put it, ‘destroying a system which Russians could endure no longer’. Yeltsin was criticised for his ‘crisis-ridden governance’ but praised for ‘giving Russians freedom, indisputably the great achievement of the Yeltsin era’. Putin’s own presidency was described as a time of efficient government and democracy...Amid all his conflicting statements, it is hard to pin down what Putin really thought of Stalin. He probably came closest to revealing his own opinion when he said: ‘Stalin was certainly a tyrant, many call him a criminal, but he was not a Nazi.'.**"*

Americans, with help from the mythmakers of Hollywood, like to believe that the United States, aided by the plucky British, played the main role in defeating Hitler’s Germany. Winston Churchill, addressing the House of Commons in August 1944, was more lucid. ‘The obvious, essential fact,’ he declared, ‘[is] that it is the Russian armies who have done the main work in tearing the guts out of the German army … No force in the world which could have been called into being … would have been able to maul and break [the Nazi regime] unless it had been subjected to the terrible slaughter that has fallen to it through the strength of the Soviet Russian armies.’...Russia lost 27 million people, 15 per cent of the population, during the war, a gargantuan blood-letting from which the country has still not recovered. For Russians, it was the defining event of the twentieth century, overshadowing the Bolshevik Revolution, the Civil War, the horrors of Stalin’s purges and the collapse of communism. The memory of those who fought in it was capable as nothing else of uniting the nation in homage. Each year on Victory Day, May 9, a military parade is held on Red Square, including, since 2008, armoured vehicles and ICBMs, and a flypast by the Russian air force.**."*

The other was religious belief, which in practice – although Russia is a multi-confessional state, whose population includes Buddhists and Jews as well as 25 million Muslims – meant Russian Orthodoxy...Traditionally the Church was such a fundamental part of Russian identity that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when countryfolk were asked what nation they belonged to, they would answer: ‘Orthodox’. The principles of tsarist rule were ‘Orthodoxy, Autocracy and National Essence’, the last of which signified that Russia should cleave to its own traditions and eschew foreign influences. In Soviet times, the Church was repressed. But, during perestroika and especially after 1991, it re-emerged, in Putin’s words, ‘like grass in a big city which grows up through the asphalt’.

But then, he thought, Putin realised that ‘Orthodoxy was the embodiment of the national idea, with a greater capacity to unify the people than any political party.’ Upwards of 80 per cent of Russians, even if they had never read the Bible and knew nothing of Christian teaching, considered themselves Orthodox.

His film, Burnt by the Sun, which told the story of a Red Army officer executed during the Stalinist terror in the 1930s, had won the Grand Prix at Cannes and an Oscar for best foreign-language film in 1995. Mikhalkov had developed a close relationship with Putin in his first term, inviting him to his home to meet Jack Nicholson and other Hollywood stars.77 They had discussed the importance of inculcating traditional Russian values into the country’s youth, who, Putin said, had ‘lost touch with their cultural roots [after] being bombarded with surrogate products from abroad’.

The Russian people is not purely European and it is not purely Asiatic. Russia … unites two worlds, and within the Russian soul, two principles are always engaged in strife – the Eastern and the Western.'....That resonated with Putin’s own thinking about Russia’s place in the world.

Yet at the same time he rejected the idea of ‘inventing some kind of local, home-grown democracy'.....But he seemed genuinely uncertain how in practice Russia should proceed. Eurasianism was fine in theory. But Russia’s culture and beliefs were fundamentally European....The key points to which Putin returned again and again were the need for developed political parties, a thriving civil society and a strong middle class, ‘the standard-bearer of [democratic] ideology’, which would defend social stability. They would not be the same as in the West. In Russia, Putin said, political parties were accountable to the state as well as society. Centralised power and democracy did not contradict each other and to suggest otherwise was to create ‘a false conflict’....It was the same principle that applied to the media and big business: political parties and civil society were free but only within the limits which the state laid down. One day that might change, Putin said, but at this stage, Russia was still taking its first steps along the path to democracy. In Europe and North America, democratic systems had developed over hundreds of years. ‘Creating fully fledged, functioning institutions [in Russia]’, he went on, ‘is not something which can be achieved overnight.’ The country had gone directly from tsarism to communism. Then, under Yeltsin, freedom and democracy had been handed down from above. ‘There was no chance for an evolutionary development, [where we could] spread out reforms over decades and wait for people’s minds to change.’...Those in the West who refused to recognise that Russia had become a more democratic state were ‘not quite honest’, Putin maintained.

Putin continued to talk from time to time about the need to diversify and carry out reforms. But it no longer seemed such a priority. To all intents and purposes, after 2007, structural economic reform was abandoned....Russia’s newfound oil wealth affected the regime in multiple ways.

After Putin gained control of Gazprom in 2001, the brothers began investing, often with loans provided by Bank Rossiya, in construction and pipeline companies which were given inflated Gazprom contracts. A 1,500-mile-long pipeline which the Rotenbergs built from a new gas field in northern Russia came in at 44 billion US dollars, three times more than a pipeline of equivalent length in Europe. Gazprom sold the brothers five construction and maintenance companies, all at a knockdown price, which they merged and transformed into one of Russia’s largest building firms. That was followed by highway construction, urban development and even educational publishing...The simple explanation was that the authorities gave lucrative contracts to companies run by members of Putin’s inner circle, allowing them to make inordinate profits at the state’s expense. As one gas industry analyst put it, ‘Gazprom switched from a principle of maximising shareholder profits to one of maximising contractor profits.’... There was actually a little more to it than that. Men like Arkady Rotenberg were canny organisers whose success owed much to their relationships with Putin and other members of the political elite but was also due to their own business acumen. As well as providing the Kremlin with a pool of money for unrecorded expenditures, they could be relied on to undertake major, prestige projects and get them done. They were rewarded accordingly....In America, that would be called crony capitalism which, indeed, it was. To Russians, it increasingly resembled the imperial court of pre-Bolshevik times.**."*

In return for their support, the new aristocracy were granted not serfs and land, as would have been the case under the tsars, but the opportunity to make their fortunes through government largesse. Cronyism was an imprecise description. It was closer to a feudal regime, in which oil wealth took the place of landed estates – a system less arbitrary than in earlier times but built on similar principles.**."*

His future will be assured, as Yeltsin’s was, not by money but by the protection of those who come after him...There are other reasons to doubt that Putin has great private wealth. As President, he has access to anything he could wish for. If he gives away a 20,000-dollar Blancpain watch to a schoolboy, it is because he can. In his position, such sums are of no consequence. His daughters are well provided for. Both married wealthy businessmen. In St Petersburg, while accepting ‘expressions of gratitude’ from trusted friends, he consistently refused to do anything which might make him beholden to those who sought his help. It is possible that he has behaved differently as President, but it appears highly unlikely. As Russia’s ruler, manipulating the elite clans and interest groups which form the basis of his support, Putin could not allow himself to behave as they did, even if he wished to. He had to operate on a higher plane, because if he abased himself to their level he would risk losing control. The much-quoted Panama Papers showed that many of his personal friends had millions or billions of dollars stashed away in fiscal paradises and that, like most of the ultra-rich, they tried to hide their wealth. But there was nothing in the Panama Papers to suggest that Putin himself had illicit riches concealed in offshore accounts.....‘My personal view,’ said Morell, ‘is that money doesn’t matter to him very much. Not personally. Money matters to him to buy the support he needs from the elite. Giving it away – giving out the ability to make money … that’s the key.’ Without being more specific, Morell made clear that that judgement was based in part on the classified information available to him at the CIA.**."*

When a journalist asked him whether he trusted other leaders, he replied: ‘You can’t ask a question like that to someone at my level. How can I trust or not trust someone else?

Would he ask the Duma to change the constitution to enable him to stay for a third term, as many of his inner circle wished? Or would he step down, in which case, who would succeed him and what would his own future hold? Putin himself had stated repeatedly that he would step down as planned. Yeltsin had relinquished power voluntarily. Not to do the same would be humiliating. It was a matter of self-respect. If he were seen to be manipulating the system simply in order to stay in office, he would be lowering himself in his own and others’ estimation and it would be a betrayal of the ideals to which he continued to pay lip service and in which, to a certain extent, he continued to believe. Moreover, being President was hard work. He had complained privately more than once, even in his first term, that he was tired of it. That was to be taken with a grain of salt, like his stories in St Petersburg about giving everything up to become a taxi driver, or to write a university thesis, or his gripes to Yumashev that he was bored by his work in the Presidential Administration. But leaving the presidency would give him an opportunity to stand back and to see whether the person he proposed as his successor was capable of governing the country in his place...“He made his first move in November 2005, nominating Dmitry Medvedev, then his Chief of Staff, as first deputy Prime Minister under Mikhail Fradkov.

Each year, between 1,200 and 2,000 soldiers died as a result of abuse – many by committing suicide – and another 1,600 or so deserted to escape maltreatment. The root of the problem was that there were no professional NCOs. Conscripts were brutalised by their older comrades. The system was known as the dedovshchina, ‘the rule of grandfather’.

The Georgian leaders were emotional and hot-headed, and the US and the Europeans were constantly warning them not get into sucked into a conflict with Russia that they could not possibly win.

Putin accused the Georgians of ethnic cleansing in Ossetia, the same argument that NATO had used to justify taking action against the Serbs. Russia portrayed Saakashvili as a latter day Milošević, and the Ossetians as oppressed by Tbilisi in the same way as the Kosovars had been oppressed by Belgrade. Most of that was a stretch. But the West’s hypocrisy in pretending that Kosovo was a ‘special case’ – an argument rejected by Cyprus, Greece and Spain and other states facing separatist movements, including Georgia itself – had finally come home to roost...Kosovo was not the proximate cause of the war with Georgia. It became inevitable only after the American overreach at Bucharest, when Bush and Condoleezza Rice had pushed through an ill-considered commitment to grant Ukraine and Georgia NATO membership. The Bush administration had assumed that Russia would accept a fourth round of NATO enlargement after the Visegrád states in 1999, the Baltic States and East and Central Europeans in 2004, and the accession of Albania and Croatia, which would take place the following spring. Ambassador Burns and others had warned that this time Putin would dig in his heels. The White House had not listened...That was compounded by another error. When Sergei Lavrov declared after Bucharest that Russia would do everything in its power to ensure that Georgia and Ukraine did not join NATO – a warning repeated a month later during a visit to NATO headquarters by the Russian Chief of Staff, General Baluyevsky – the White House did not take that seriously either....The result was that a lame duck American President, who had alienated many of his European colleagues, found himself powerless to protect an ally whose adventurism had been abetted by the political, military and economic support his administration had provided....For Georgia the war was a disaster. The two territories Saakashvili had wished to recover were irretrievably lost...For the United States, the consequences were more nuanced. Bush would shortly be succeeded by a Democrat, Barack Obama, who would try a new approach to Russia. But Bush had left a troubling legacy. The spectacle of American forces bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq had shown that the United States, even if it had become the world’s sole superpower, was not the all-powerful hegemon it had imagined itself to be.

The need for change had become painfully evident, he said, when, as Prime Minister in the autumn of 1999, Yeltsin had given him charge of the war in Chechnya. Out of 1.4 million men in the armed forces, only 55,000 were in combat-ready units and they were dispersed all over the country. ‘That is how we ended up sending into battle kids untested by fire to be butchered’, Putin said. ‘I will not forget that ever.’ The following year he approved plans gradually to transition to a fully professional army.....The root of the problem was the mindset..The Soviet army, like the tsarist army before it, had been based on the idea of mass mobilisation. The Russian military followed the same model. From the standpoint of the officer corps, the system had distinct advantages. In the early 2000s, the Russian army had more colonels than lieutenants and one officer for every two ordinary ranks. The huge officer corps was needed, it was claimed, in case one day the civilian population had to be drafted in time of war...But as well as being the foundation of the system, conscription was its Achilles’ heel. The falling birth rate since the 1980s meant that there were no longer enough draftees to go round, and since wealthier and better educated students usually managed to avoid serving, the quality of the recruits was lamentable....it was announced that conscripts would no longer be sent to Chechnya or other war zones....On paper, it looked like a great success. The Georgian war showed that in practice it had been a total failure....The failure of the modernisation programme was blamed on the Defence Minister, Sergei Ivanov. But Putin was also responsible. Having initially embraced the concept of a fully professional army, he had got cold feet....By 2011, the army command had been forced to accept that, no matter what it did, demographic considerations made a conscript army impossible. In any case, hi-tech weaponry needed skilled professionals, not cannon fodder. The General Staff announced that the transition to a fully professional force would continue and that the draft might end completely in 2017. That did not happen, but from 2012 onwards, the makeup of the armed forces stabilised.... Financial constraints were partly responsible: contract personnel cost much more than conscripts. But Putin and others in the political elite also saw the draft as promoting patriotism and maintaining the link between the military and the civilian population. In Western countries where conscription had been abolished, civilians’ readiness to fight in defence of the homeland had notably declined.**."*

The collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, fuelled by risky bank lending – the so-called sub-prime mortgage crisis – was about to trigger what would become known as the Great Recession. In September, the US investment bank, Lehmann Brothers, failed. A cascade of even bigger failures was prevented only by huge taxpayer-funded bailouts. Between a fifth and a quarter of American household wealth was wiped out. Consumption fell precipitously, credit dried up and investment ground to a halt. The old adage, ‘when America sneezes, Europe catches a cold’, showed its truth yet again. But in the new, globalised world of the twenty-first century, it was not just Europe that suffered. Every country was affected....Putin tried to see a positive side to the crisis. The problems in the United States, he said, were ‘a further step towards strengthening a multipolar world’. The American system had shown itself incapable of resolving the problems it created. ‘Faith in the United States as leader of the free world and the free market … has been undermined, I think forever,’ he said, in an access of wishful thinking. ‘It will never return to what it was before.'....By October, the Russian stock market had fallen 75 per cent from its May highs and trading was suspended so frequently that Russians joked it was like a cuckoo clock.40 The price of oil, which touched an all-time high of 129 US dollars a barrel for Urals crude in July, was down to 40 dollars a barrel nine months later, before recovering to 70 dollars by the end of 2009. Russia’s 25 wealthiest men saw their assets slashed by 230 billion dollars over the course of a few months. But, initially at least, ordinary people were not affected. Only one per cent of the population owned shares and one in three had no bank account. Russia had 600 billion dollars in foreign-exchange reserves, which supported the value of the rouble, and the Stabilisation Fund made up for the shortfall in budget revenue. Despite price hikes, growing arrears of unpaid wages and rising unemployment, protests remained limited. Memories of the 1990s, when shock therapy had caused much greater economic pain, were sufficiently recent for people to think twice before going out onto the streets and, in the second half of 2009, once oil prices had started to recover, the recession began to ease....Nonetheless, it was a turning point. For the next decade or more, the Russian economy essentially stagnated. Putin’s hopes of transitioning to a skills-based economic model, which he had unveiled with great fanfare during the 2008 election campaign, were quietly abandoned. Even in the best of circumstances, that would have been a stretch. He had proposed that by 2020, labour productivity would quadruple, Russia would become one of the top five nations in terms of GDP after the US, China, Japan and Germany, the middle class would make up 60 to 70 per cent of the population and average life expectancy – still only 68 years in 2008 – would increase to 75. The last target was almost met: in 2020, Russian life expectancy reached 73 years, eight and a half years more than in the mid 1990s, though that was still not enough to arrest the country’s long-term demographic decline. But the other goals were unattainable. By 2020, nominal GDP had fallen back to the level of 2007. Far from becoming one of the top five global economies, Russia slipped from tenth to eleventh place.**."*

Medvedev approved overflight rights for the US to supply its forces in Afghanistan. America, in turn, supported Russia’s long-standing efforts to gain admission to the World Trade Organisation, which finally came to fruition, after 18 years of negotiations, in December 2011...Obama saw Medvedev as ‘a poster child for the new Russia, young, trim and clothed in hip, European-tailored suits’. The Russian President was affable, he wrote later, ‘with a slightly formal, almost self-deprecating manner, more international management consultant than politician or party apparatchik’. The two men had a lot in common. Both had studied and taught law, they were of similar age and both had young families...how much leeway Medvedev had to make policy on his own and to what extent he was constrained by the need to respect the views of his predecessor, now Prime Minister....Spending the evening privately with Medvedev and his wife, Svetlana, at their residence at Gorki, he found himself discussing Silicon Valley and IT, which fascinated the Russian leader...Next morning, when he met Putin, the atmosphere was very different. There was ‘a casualness to his movements,’ Obama wrote, ‘a practiced disinterest in his voice, that indicated someone who’d grown used to power.'...Obama felt that the Russian leader was at least open to the reset effort, if not enthusiastic. As he left, Putin noted that in future, the discussions would be with Medvedev. ‘These are now his decisions,’ he said. Obama said later that he had doubted that last statement. But, on the surface, that was how it appeared. Medvedev became Obama’s sole interlocutor. Putin made clear that, as Prime Minister, he did not see it as his role to receive visiting heads of state. ‘In the division of powers in Russia,’ he said, ‘the President has the last word, and the President today is Mr Medvedev.’ It was a matter of respect for the function.**."*

It was assumed that the two men were constantly jockeying for position and that, sooner or later, Medvedev would try to push Putin aside. That was never the case. On matters of human rights and social and economic policy, there were important differences of style, but much less in terms of substance. Medvedev made a fetish of modernisation. He gave interviews to liberal newspapers which Putin would have disdained. But the media were, if anything, less free during his presidency than they had been under Putin, and while there was much talk of innovation, of economic reform and of the struggle against corruption, it was no more than talk. In practice, little changed.**."*

Then, pointing to a copy of an agreement they had drafted, he threw his pen across the table and told him to sign. As a further humiliation, once the magnate had complied, Putin snapped: ‘Now give me back my pen.’ Within hours, the accumulated back wages – the equivalent of 1.5 million US dollars – were transferred to the workers’ accounts, and Russian television showed long lines of people waiting to withdraw money from cashpoints.....The display of prime ministerial wrath was to show Russians that Putin was there to defend them against predatory tycoons and, as Putin himself later acknowledged, ‘to send a message to leaders at all levels … that they would be held accountable for developments in their areas’. It was also, as both Russian and Western commentators noted at the time, not something which Dmitry Medvedev would have been able to do.**."*

The political situation in Ukraine had changed dramatically since the previous gas crisis two years earlier. Tymoshenko was back in Yushchenko’s government as Prime Minister but their relations had again deteriorated and by September 2008, she had forged a tactical alliance with her pro-Russian opponent, Viktor Yanukovych. The gas issue became embroiled in Ukrainian domestic politics and, on New Year’s Day, 2009, Russia turned off the supply, not only to Ukraine but also to the rest of Europe. After two weeks of inconclusive discussions, Tymoshenko and Putin held a late-night meeting in Moscow which became famous not for the resulting accord but for the little black dress the Ukrainian Premier wore, which, as one Ukrainian commentator delicately put it, merited a place in the Museum of Ukrainian Diplomacy. The Russian media, less given to subtlety, guffawed that it had a zip all the way down the back, which meant it was ‘able to be removed in a single movement'...The substance of the agreement was that the gas price would rise incrementally over the next ten years to reach European prices. No less important, Gazprom would deal directly with the Ukrainian state gas company, cutting out RosUkrEnergo, a dubious Swiss-registered intermediary, allegedly controlled by Semyon Mogilevich, a mafia kingpin with high-level protection in Moscow.**."*

So that made it more difficult.....It took time for the US administration to realise that its assumption that Medvedev and Putin were essentially on the same wavelength on foreign policy issues was not necessarily correct. ‘What became clear, but wasn’t clear to us initially was that Medvedev was pushing out in front of Putin and trying to create his own political identity as someone who could work with the West.’ The problem was that neither the Americans nor Medvedev himself could be sure how far he could push before he exceeded the limits which Putin would accept. Ideally, Rhodes acknowledged, the White House should have tried harder to keep lines to Putin open, but in practice that was all but impossible because of the Prime Minister’s insistence that, in matters of US–Russian relations, Medvedev was in charge.**."*

It was a riff on Bush’s statement at Ljubljana that he had looked into Putin’s eyes and ‘got a sense of his soul’. Putin had taken note. ‘I think, as a minimum,’ he said acidly, ‘a state official needs to have a head.’ .....Clinton’s distrust of Russia, which she wore as a badge of honour, was not the best basis on which to seek a fresh beginning.....To change the subject, she asked him about his conservation efforts for Siberian tigers. His demeanour changed instantly, she wrote, and he got up and took her down a long corridor and through an armoured door to his private office, where he launched into an animated discussion – in English, which he never normally spoke during negotiations with foreign visitors – about tigers and polar bears and other endangered species. He was going to Franz Josef Land in the Russian Arctic later that spring to tag polar bears, he said. Would her husband like to come with him?....It could have been an opening. She did not follow up.

In Russia, where the war is seen as the defining moment of the country’s modern history, such things have immense importance. Ambassador Beyrle had the respect of the Kremlin not merely because of his position but because of his family history. McFaul was an academic who described himself as a ‘specialist in democracy, movements against dictatorship and revolutions’, an ardent supporter of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and a severe critic of Putin and his regime. To Moscow, it was the kind of appointment that a foreign government would make if it wished to implement a strategy of tension. It had apparently never occurred to anyone in the White House that Putin might not take kindly to the “ nomination of someone with McFaul’s views and antecedents...Whether it would have made any difference if Beyrle had stayed on or if Hillary Clinton had been more empathetic to Russian concerns is another matter. Personal chemistry is important and its absence can be a drawback. But it does not change underlying realities.**."*

However, it appeared that what was to follow had been left deliberately vague. It would have made no sense for Putin to commit himself one way or the other until he saw how Medvedev performed. Part of the point of the exercise was to find out whether the younger man was a possible long-term successor. Putin had no desire to stay in power for life, as was the case of some of his fellow leaders in Central Asia, and given the nature of the system he presided over, the succession was a matter of vital concern...Sometime in 2010, around the midpoint of his presidency, Medvedev started to believe that Putin was open to the idea of him standing for a second term.**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**But then Medvedev began pushing a little bit too hard...Medvedev gave a speech in St Petersburg to mark the 150th anniversary of the abolition of serfdom. Ostensibly about Russian history, it was widely viewed as a coded appeal to Russian liberals. ‘Freedom cannot be postponed,’ Medvedev said. ‘The nation … cannot be kept together by tightened screws … Excessively harsh policies [lead] not to the elimination of corruption but to its growth, not to the evolution of governance but to its degradation.’ The idea that Russia should follow some kind of special way was a fantasy, he said. Russia should look to the example of the Tsar Liberator, Aleksandr II, who had freed the serfs and sought to install ‘a normal, humane order’, not ‘Nicholas I or Stalin’ – a line which many in the audience took to refer to Putin....Medvedev presumably thought the historical allusion sufficiently obscure for Putin to let it pass. But he was venturing onto dangerous ground. Moreover, he had recently lost an important source of insights into the way Putin’s mind was working.**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**Whether for that reason or because Medvedev had grown overconfident, in March he committed a fatal error....The West hailed the Arab Spring as a movement bringing democracy to the region. Putin saw it differently. He agreed that the ousted leaders had brought their troubles on themselves by refusing to recognise the need for change. But no one could foresee what the results of the upheaval would be. ‘One cannot simply transfer a familiar template to other regions of the world. We need to let other peoples determine their fate and their future in their own way,’ he said. After Egypt and Tunisia, the Libyan regime was now teetering. If Colonel Gaddafi were overthrown, Putin warned, it might have ‘negative consequences for … Europe’ – cautionary words which European leaders preferred to forget when Libya became a failed state and 650,000 economic migrants from sub-Saharan Africa poured across its borders to be trafficked by smugglers to Italy...Medvedev shared Putin’s pessimism. If the North African states disintegrated, he thought, fanatics might come to power, bringing further conflagrations and the rise of extremism.... a coalition of Western countries, led by Britain, France and Italy, joined by Qatar and, later, Turkey, with air support from the United States, launched sustained attacks on Libyan government military formations. It became clear almost at once that it was not an operation to restore peace or even to protect the civilian population, but a coordinated attack led by NATO to overthrow Gaddafi’s regime, little different from George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq, but this time with UN cover. Obama acknowledged later that he had had grave reservations. ‘Why Libya and not the Congo, for example, where a series of civil conflicts had resulted in millions of civilian deaths?’ he asked. He left the question unanswered. Libya was a small, oil-rich Arab state, strategically placed across the Mediterranean from Southern Europe. The Congo was neither oil rich nor strategically located. As in most wars of choice, the moral justification for intervention cloaked a decision taken for political reasons.**."*

The UN resolution, he said, was ‘defective and flawed … It allows them to do what they like, to undertake any manner of actions against a sovereign state. It reminds me of a medieval crusade.’ The West used force in international affairs with no thought for the consequences. America had done so in the Balkans, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, ‘and now it’s Libya’s turn’....He was careful to add that he was merely giving his ‘personal opinion’, leaving the door open for Medvedev to accuse NATO of having gone beyond its UN mandate, as was indeed the case. Instead the President dug himself deeper into the hole he had made for himself. He had personally ordered the Foreign Ministry not to veto the resolution, he said. ‘It is entirely unacceptable,’ he went on, ‘to use expressions which indicate a clash of civilisations. The word, “crusade”, for instance. We must all remember that such language could make the situation even worse.' It was a direct rebuttal of everything Putin had said....The state-owned television channels, which had been prominently featuring Putin’s remarks, were at a loss to know what to do. It had never happened before that the President and the Prime Minister had directly contradicted each other. Eventually word came from Putin’s aides that, since the President was responsible for foreign affairs, ‘Prime Minister Putin’s statement should be forgotten’. That evening, only Medvedev’s comment was broadcast....It looked as though he had come out on top. In fact, he had committed political suicide. Had Medvedev dissociated himself from the decision to abstain, Putin might conceivably have pardoned his misjudgement. Doubling down on it sealed his fate. Nothing more was said publicly, but in private, Putin was quoted as saying: ‘Don’t worry … Come September, we’ll do what we have to do and everyone will breathe a sigh of relief.’.**."*

A commentator on Ekho Moskvy mocked him as ‘just an adjective that goes with the noun, Putin’. Medvedev was blamed for being soft on terror after bomb attacks in Moscow and St Petersburg killed more than a hundred people and injured several hundred more. During Putin’s second term, there had been no large-scale attacks.

In fact, his outrage, while real, had a different purpose. He emphasised Gaddafi’s sordid end – ‘horrible and repulsive scenes of [his] murder, with footage of his bloody body broadcast all over the world’ – in order to pin the responsibility more firmly on the United States, whose special forces, he claimed – falsely – had been present at his death....The United States had shown itself once again – at least in Putin’s mind – to be ruthless and untrustworthy. To justify invading Iraq, a Republican administration under George W. Bush had promoted a fabricated story about non-existent weapons of mass destruction.

This was a conscious decision on Putin’s part. Like the freedom allowed to Russian newspapers and privately owned radio stations, it was thought to be a necessary safety valve. Chinese-style censorship would be ‘technologically difficult and wrong politically’, he said. But the result was that the social media networks, which had had little influence a few years earlier, now gave the regime’s critics a means of organising that the Kremlin had not had to deal with before....'the bar of public expectations has risen.'

The very people who had benefitted most from his regime – the up-and-coming middle classes who lived so much better than their parents could have dreamed of, who dressed like their peers in Western Europe, who bought their groceries in supermarkets no different from those in London or Paris and went on holiday to Turkey or Cyprus – these were the people who had now turned against him. And not only in Moscow: tens of thousands turned out for protest rallies in St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Rostov-na-Donu and other large provincial cities. As Kudrin noted, these were people who valued stability and had a lot to lose. But the way the Kremlin had played fast and loose with the rules, falsifying the elections, was more than they were prepared to accept.....Putin was uncertain how to react, and it showed....His first instinct was to sneer, just as he had sneered that the murdered Anatoly Litvinenko was ‘unfortunately’ not Lazarus and that Anna Politkovskaya had had virtually no influence in Russia until she was killed. The white ribbons which the protesters wore looked like condoms, he said. The students who took part had been paid to attend. The organisers were trying to destabilise Russia, in the same way that the Orange Revolution had destabilised Ukraine. He gave the impression of flailing about, trying to find a convincing explanation for something that had not been supposed to happen. But at another level he evidently recognised that he had to reach out to the protesters. He was still far and away the most popular leader in Russia and the demonstrators were a tiny minority, less than one per cent of the population as a whole.

We are a nation of winners, it’s in our genetic code.’ As if to counter the fiery oratory of Navalny, he abandoned his usual reserve and tried to build an emotional bond with the crowd. ‘Do we love Russia?’ he asked. ‘Will we win? … I’ll ask you again: Do we love Russia?’ The assembled multitude, many of whom had been bussed in by their employers, dutifully responded: ‘Yes!’ But it did not come naturally and fell rather flat.

After 12 years in power, Putin had come to see himself as the incarnation of the state. He felt ‘one with the Russian soil,’ he said. ‘Russia is my life … Not for a second can I imagine myself without her … It’s not just love that I feel … I feel part of our people.’ It was not a president but a priest-king speaking.**."*

It was what he had told his teacher, Vera Gurevich, as a boy at primary school, when he was reprimanded for getting into a fight: ‘There are people who can’t or won’t understand, no matter how you try to explain to them. The only thing they understand is strength.’ The disaffection of the middle class had come as a shock...But the aspirations of this new bourgeoisie that he had helped to bring into being now threatened to undermine his rule.**."*

- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**When the full story emerged, it became clear that it was part of an elaborate mise en scène. Russia was gearing up for the Winter Olympics, which were to be held in Sochi in February 2014. Relations with the West were testy. Putin wanted to avoid any repetition of what had happened to the Soviet Union in 1980, when the United States and most of its allies had boycotted the Moscow Olympics in protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Freeing Navalny was a goodwill gesture to those concerned about human rights in Russia. But that was merely the prelude. An even bigger surprise would follow. The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, was to stand for re-election that autumn. Putin had decided that Navalny would be allowed to stand against him. Holding a genuinely competitive election in Moscow, he thought, would show that, despite the crackdown on protest demonstrations and NGOs, Russia was much more democratic than it was given credit for. On the President’s instructions, Sobyanin worked behind the scenes to ensure that Navalny obtained the requisite number of signatures to take part and, on the last day before the lists closed, he was registered as a candidate.**."*

The mayoral elections in Moscow in September 2013, were the freest in Russia for 20 years.39 Nor was it an isolated case....Other conciliatory gestures followed, also with the Olympics in view. In October, the Constitutional Court ruled that a criminal conviction would no longer entail a lifetime ban on standing for public office. Navalny’s five-year suspended prison term, if confirmed on appeal, would therefore disqualify him from taking part in the presidential election in 2018 but afterwards, in theory, his ineligibility would end...Putin announced that he would pardon the former oligarch, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who by then had spent more than ten years in prison.

He had flown to Guatemala to meet the International Olympic Committee and, when presenting Russia’s candidature, had addressed them in English, something he had never done before and would not do again. It would be a unique opportunity, he thought, to show the world how Russia had changed. Fifteen years earlier, the Goodwill Games in St Petersburg, even with the limited means then available, had opened the eyes of Western visitors to the new Russia emerging under Yeltsin. The Beijing Olympics, a decade and a half later, with a television audience of hundreds of millions, had transformed China’s image internationally. Putin hoped that the Sochi Games would do something similar. They would be Russia’s coming-out party – a national celebration of its coming of age as a post-Soviet power.**."*

They were accused of having fraudulently extorted 30 million roubles, or about 600,000 US dollars. The evidence was non-existent. The amount allegedly stolen had been earned over the previous three years for services the Navalnys’ company had provided. But on December 30, 2014, Oleg was sentenced to three and a half years in a labour camp. Aleksei Navalny received the same sentence but, as in the KirovLes trial, it was suspended....Putin was concerned that if Navalny were imprisoned, he would become a martyr. Far better to attack him where he was most vulnerable, through his family. That was confirmed a few days later when Navalny announced that, in view of his brother’s imprisonment, he was removing his electronic bracelet and would no longer respect the conditions of his house arrest.

Russia’s spirituality had been in decline and renewed efforts were needed to reverse that. ‘We must be and remain Russian … We must wholeheartedly support those institutions which are the bearers of traditional values.’...That meant ever greater emphasis on the role of the Orthodox Church, coupled with a new stress on family values and ‘patriotic education’. The church, under Patriarch Kirill, had become a pillar of the state and a political force to be reckoned with. Family values were more of a problem. Most Russians were extremely conservative in their view of the relations between men and women.**."*

We need to heal these wounds and repair the tissue of our historic fabric … We must be proud of our history, and we have things to be proud of.

All three works exalt Russian exceptionalism, the country’s unique role in the world and its singular culture and history, and warn that the West tries constantly to undermine its spiritual purity.

But for all his frustration with the West, Putin was not an ultra-nationalist, imbued with hatred, as Ilyin was. He still believed that Russia and Europe belonged to ‘the same civilisation [with] the same ingrained values’. They were different, he said, because the Russian mentality had developed under serfdom and was rooted in a sense of community, whereas Europeans had had to fend for themselves in a competitive, market-based environment.86 That was both good and bad, he thought.

But inside we have very different values.’ Medvedev was then President and Putin may have been trying to warn the Administration not to assume that the personable young Russian leader, who appeared so Westernised, thought in the same way as they did. Nonetheless, it was a revealing comment. In Soviet times, many Russians did indeed seem to inhabit a different mental universe from the Westerners with whom they dealt. But that was becoming a thing of the past. For men like Medvedev, who had grown up under perestroika, it had already begun to change, and for the post-Soviet cohort, it was hardly so at all....Differences between the generations were more pronounced in Russia than in Western Europe or America because the change of system after the collapse of communist rule in 1991 had been total. Putin’s concern, however, was less with the behaviour of younger people – a tolerance which may have stemmed from his memories of his own truculent youth – than with their lack of a sense of national identity. He complained of their ‘appalling’ ignorance of their country’s past and quoted his favourite historian, Vasily Klyuchevsky: ‘“History doesn’t teach anything, but it punishes those who haven’t learnt their lessons” … We cannot build a nation without it.'**."*

The foundations of patriotism, Putin said, were laid down during childhood and youth, and it was on that basis that Russia’s future would be built....Stalin’s purges were still mentioned but paired with glowing accounts of the country’s industrialisation.....The new guidelines exalted military glory, especially in 1812, the first ‘Great Patriotic War’ when Napoleon was repulsed; and 1945, the second, when Nazi Germany was defeated....Tsarist Russia was presented as a multi-ethnic state, fundamentally different from the colonial empires of Britain and France....The ‘concept’ extolled Russia’s unique role in the world – Moscow, it reminded the country’s teachers, had been the Third Rome of the Orthodox Church – and its impact on global history.

Obama had told the world that the use of chemical weapons was a red line that Assad must not cross.

Asymmetrically, the Duma passed legislation forbidding the adoption of Russian children by American families....The ban, he said, was not aimed at American parents, most of whom were ‘good, decent people’. It was necessary because the American justice system failed to prosecute when children were abused and denied Russian consular officials access to the proceedings. That was a humiliation which Russia would not accept. Other nations could continue to adopt Russian children, but not Americans...The real reason lay elsewhere.

The country’s role in the break-up of the Soviet Union; the status of Crimea; squabbles over the lease of port facilities at Sevastopol for Russia’s Black Sea fleet, arguments over the demarcation of the two countries’ borders; disputes over culture, language, history and even between rival branches of the Orthodox Church – all ensured that Ukraine would be Russia’s prickliest partner, no matter who was in power in Moscow or in Kyiv. The Orange Revolution had been a nightmare for Putin, who continued to have great difficulty navigating the country’s constantly shifting political alliances. Nevertheless, after returning to the presidency in 2012, he decided to make one more attempt to bring Ukraine back into the Russian fold where he was convinced it rightly belonged....One of Putin’s key priorities – ‘the core of our foreign policy and our strategic objective’, as he put it – was to strengthen integration among the post-Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States. This was in part to compensate for Russia’s deteriorating relationship with the West. The three largest CIS states, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, together with Belarus, had signed a treaty ten years earlier to set up a Common Economic Space as the nucleus of a future Eurasian Economic Union, which Putin envisaged as a Russian-led alternative to the EU. But after the Orange Revolution, the next step, the establishment of a Customs Union, had stalled. Putin argued that going ahead with the union would create a powerful economic bloc of 210 million people, which would be in all their interests.56 Viktor Yanukovych, now back as Ukraine’s President, was torn. In March 2012, he had initialled an Association Agreement with the European Union, a possible first step to eventual EU membership. But the European Commission insisted that, before it could be signed, Kyiv would have to take significant steps to reduce corruption, strengthen democracy and improve the rule of law. Yanukovych, who was corrupt to the core, realised that that might be difficult....At this point, it might still have been possible to find a compromise. But Russia’s attitude to the EU had changed. Initially Putin had seen it as a positive force, an independent power centre which, unlike NATO, was not always condemned to follow America’s lead....But gradually the relationship had soured. By the time that Ukraine’s Association Agreement came under discussion, Putin was starting to regard the EU as a stalking horse for NATO. He told Angela Merkel: ‘When I look at the membership of the EU and I look at the membership of NATO, I see basically the same thing. So when I hear about an Association Agreement for Ukraine, I know that NATO will follow.’**."*

That was not in either country’s interest and it was not clear how Putin would react.**."*

For anyone with a knowledge of history, this was not difficult to foresee.'...Putin had made clear at Bucharest that any move towards Ukrainian membership of NATO would have grave consequences. The Georgian war had been a warning, and had been intended as such, of how Russia was likely to react if that were ever to happen. The Europeans insisted that the EU was quite separate from NATO and blithely assumed that Ukraine’s association would not pose any particular problem. It was not merely short-sighted, it was wilfully blind....The Americans were equally blinkered. Vice President Joe Biden, whom Obama had put in charge of Ukrainian matters, had immense experience of American politics but knew little of the sensitivities at work in Kyiv and Moscow.....For all the high-minded talk out of Washington about promoting human rights and freedoms, neither the United States nor Russia had any real concern for Ukrainian interests and it was hypocritical to pretend otherwise. Washington’s goal was to expand American influence into the areas along Russia’s borders.....called Ukraine ‘the biggest prize’ for America to pluck from Russia’s grasp...characterised it as a buffer state – ‘a bulwark against Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, … crucial to US and NATO interests’....That this was how the US viewed Ukraine should have been a surprise to no-one and it certainly was not to Putin. It is what dominant powers do. The two principal protagonists were engaged in a geopolitical zero-sum game in which America’s gain was Russia’s loss.

Afterwards Merkel told Obama that she was ‘not sure he was in touch with reality – [he seemed to be] in another world’. The only certainty was that neither the United States nor any other Western government was contemplating a military response. Putin’s instincts had been correct. There would be symbolic protests against the takeover of Crimea and, no doubt, economic sanctions.

The territory’s history was a saga of ‘Russian military glory and outstanding valour’. When Khrushchev had given it to Ukraine, ‘Russia was not simply robbed, it was plundered.’...The second, more urgent, reason was to prevent Ukraine joining NATO. ‘If we hadn’t done anything,’ Putin said, ‘Ukraine would have been drawn into NATO at some point in the future, and we’d have been told, “This isn’t your business.”’ As long as Ukraine was embroiled in a territorial dispute with its neighbours, NATO membership was ruled out.**."*

Geography condemns Ukraine and Russia to be neighbours and ultimately neighbouring countries have to find a way to coexist. The war between Russia and Georgia had had no lasting consequences. Turkey had occupied northern Cyprus since 1974 but had suffered only token condemnation.103 Putin initially assumed that the annexation of Crimea would be the same....If the goal was to keep Ukraine out of NATO, the annexation of Crimea was sufficient.

The annexation of Crimea had brought further intractable problems. But after the shooting down of the Malaysian airliner, a door slammed shut. It was one of those pivotal moments that influence everything that follows.

But in what way were they different? ‘Is it that the so-called moderates behead people more delicately or in more limited numbers?’ The only realistic policy, he argued, was to support Assad’s government, because without the participation of the Syrian army, it was not possible to eliminate the jihadist threat.

The awfulness of their plight was brought home to Europeans, who until then had paid little attention, sitting comfortably in their living rooms watching the news on television, by a single heart-wrenching image of a dead toddler, whose body had washed up on a Turkish beach, lying doubled up, face down on the sand.**."*

But they were talking about different things. Putin sought an alliance ‘similar to the anti-Hitler coalition, willing to stand firm against those who, like the Nazis, sow evil and hatred’. He looked to the Syrian government, the Kurdish militias in northern Syria and Iraq, and the regional powers, Egypt, Iran and its protégé, Hezbollah. The United States looked to its traditional allies – Australia, Britain, France and the Sunni states along the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, the Arab Emirates and Qatar – all of which continued to demand Assad’s departure....It was ‘a great mistake’ to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian authorities, Putin said, because the Syrian army and the Kurds were the only ones really fighting ISIS. The jihadists were ‘not stupid’, he said. ‘They are as smart as you [Americans].’ They sought Assad’s overthrow in order to create the same kind of chaos that allowed them to flourish in Libya and Iraq.

To Putin, that was hypocrisy. ‘Attempts to spare terrorists under the pretext of protecting civilians are unacceptable,’ he said. ‘We keep hearing, Aleppo, Aleppo, Aleppo. But what is the issue here? Do we leave the terrorists in place, or do we squeeze them out? … Look at Israel’s example. Israel never steps back but fights to the end and that is how it survives. There is no alternative.

Putin had developed good relations with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s President and earlier long-time Prime Minister. Six million Russian tourists visited Turkey each year, Russia was building a nuclear power station at Akkuyu, on the Mediterranean coast, and the two countries had recently reached agreement on a pipeline project under the Black Sea – a substitute for an earlier scheme known as South Stream, which had been rejected by the European Commission when José Barroso was President – to provide Russian natural gas to Turkey and South-East and Central Europe. On the other hand, Turkey was a member of NATO and Erdoğan, like the rest of the alliance, wanted Assad out of power.

America itself was arguably more divided than at any time since the Civil War. The political system was dysfunctional, Congress so polarised that Democrats and Republicans were unable to work together on even the most anodyne subjects and society so divided that each camp was convinced that the other was bent on the country’s destruction...Trump’s election was the culmination, not the cause, of these problems, which had been accumulating in plain sight since Reagan’s presidency in the 1980s.

It was part of a broader response to the economic and military pressures which the United States and its allies were exerting to punish what they termed Russia’s bad behaviour and what Putin depicted as his country’s refusal to submit to American diktat.

The West’s argument that NATO had no choice but to accept new members from Central and Eastern Europe was false. It was true that other countries had the right to apply, but that did not mean that the existing members were obliged to accept them if they thought it was contrary to their own interests. ‘They could have said: “we are pleased that you want to join us, but we are not going to expand our organisation because we see the future of Europe differently” … If they had wanted to, they could have [refused].

But in the early days, amid the euphoria which marked the end of the Cold War, when the West assumed that Russia was destined to become part of the American-led world and Moscow was far too weak to resist, none of America’s partners thought it worthwhile to object.

The United States, they say, supported NATO enlargement not to threaten Russia but to reassure America’s European allies. The reality was more galling and more prosaic. The United States acted as it did because it could.....At one level, Putin acknowledged with some bitterness, Russia had been at fault for failing to foresee that. ‘Our biggest mistake,’ he told an American scholar, ‘was to trust you too much.

The G7’s share of global GDP had dropped from 70 per cent, in the early 1990s, to 45 per cent two decades later. China would soon become the world’s leading economic power.

Like the other liberal leaders who had come to the fore under Yeltsin, his time had passed. He posed no political threat...As had been the case when the journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, had been murdered eight years earlier, Nemtsov acquired a symbolic importance after his death which was disproportionate to his role before he died. Politkovskaya had been assassinated on Putin’s birthday. Nemtsov had been killed 150 yards from the Kremlin, where Putin worked. In both cases, once the fog of conspiracy theories cleared, responsibility was traced back to the entourage of the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov....Until Nemtsov’s death, Putin’s reluctance to bring Kadyrov to heel was purely pragmatic. Chechnya was unmanageable. Kadyrov’s excesses were tolerated because his iron-fisted rule kept the region under control. After Nemtsov’s murder, that changed.**."*

As Putin’s third term was nearing an end, Medvedev was approaching his sell-by date. He had lost all credibility not only with the liberal intelligentsia but with the population at large. But when Aleksei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation posted a 50-minute documentary on YouTube, alleging that he had received 1.2 billion US dollars in bribes from Russian business magnates, disguised as donations to a charitable foundation, Putin immediately went out of his way to show his support. Whatever thoughts he might have had of replacing Medvedev were shelved....The documentary drew millions of views and provoked widespread demonstrations. But Navalny was struck by the fact that no one seemed to find the revelations surprising. ‘You make a case that someone has taken more than a billion dollars in bribes, and what’s the reaction? Everyone says: “What’s so interesting about that?”.....Russians had long since lost any illusions about the regime’s failure to rein in corruption....The effects were felt at the grassroots as well. ‘Under Yeltsin,’ one woman complained, ‘if a traffic policeman flagged you down, you would hand over your driving licence with the equivalent of a few dollars tucked inside and he’d wave you on. Now they play with you. They can hold you for hours to see how much they can make you pay. And it isn’t a few dollars any more.'**..."*

Graft had become the glue that held the system together...In the decade since the Great Recession, Russia had seen zero growth and real incomes had fallen. Yet the opinion polls indicated that, despite the economic woes and Putin’s failure to tackle corruption, his approval rating remained above 80 per cent.52 In elections for the Duma in September 2016, the ruling party, United Russia, won more than three quarters of the 450 seats, its best performance ever...There were several reasons for this. Most Russians were still cock-a-hoop over the return of Crimea. To older people, Putin, for all his faults, was seen as a guarantor that there would be no return to the chaos of the 1990s. Moreover, there was no real alternative. Putin himself admitted that the available choices were ‘a little bit boring'.....Those who were genuinely critical of the regime faced multiple obstacles.

It was ‘simply preposterous’ to carry out a police raid in a case like that. ‘In our country the security forces are used at the drop of a hat, even when it is completely uncalled for. It makes no sense, and it made no sense in this case.’...Serebrennikov did not suffer the same fate as Meyerhold: times had changed......'The system of the law enforcers’ lawlessness, which was built to strengthen the President’s power, has finally become deranged … Putin either does not want or is not able to intervene.’ Other newspapers commented in the same vein. ‘Something has gone wrong in this country’, wrote Moskovsky komsomolets. ‘Now the “fools” are showing that they, not the President, are in charge.’...That was certainly what it looked like.

The growing influence of the siloviki was another. But they were merely facets of a much broader shift, both in the Kremlin and in the country at large, towards conservative values....suppressing ‘non-traditional’ culture had become the norm.....Not only were liberal values in retreat. The very concept of democracy was being questioned. Throughout his first two terms, Putin had insisted that Russia’s future was as a democratic state, albeit in a form which would take due account of its history and traditions. Now, he suggested, Russians might not yet be quite ready for that. ‘It’s a very complex process and there are certain stages that cannot be skipped,’ he said. ‘Our citizens have to get used to it.’...The message between the lines was that, given Russia’s economic difficulties and the hostility of the United States and its European allies, it was time to return to a more autocratic style of rule.

Dmitry Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote that the document marked ‘an important milestone in the country’s official abandonment of the liberal phraseology of the 1990s’. But phraseology and underlying beliefs do not always coincide. It was true that the West’s share of the global economy was declining, and anyone with a Marxist education would infer that Western influence in the realm of ideas – the ‘superstructure’, as Marx called it – would decline as well. On the other hand, liberal ideas had always proved remarkably resilient....Regardless of whether Putin believed it, it was smart politics....The principles he now espoused were shared by many conservatives in Europe and the United States and they resonated deeply in Russia, especially among those who lived outside the big cities and formed the critical mass of Putin’s political base.**."

In December 2019, he repeated the same words he had used a quarter of a century before: ‘They put a time bomb under Russia.’ This time, however, he blamed Lenin by name. One of the journalists present remembered ‘something close to rage on his face’ as he spoke.

In May 2000, only ten days after his inauguration, he told an interviewer: ‘I am not going to be here forever … Sooner or later, we all leave our posts.’ The following year he said that he always thought twice before taking decisions, because the day would come when, as an ordinary citizen, ‘you will be confronted with what you have done.’In 2003, he reflected anew. ‘When a person stays in power too long, no matter how good he is, his drive is blunted, he doesn’t have the same “fire in his belly” as at the start of the journey.

As the economy had improved, the birth rate had increased, the death rate had fallen and life expectancy had risen to 68 years for men and 78 for women, not far behind the United States. But the hole in the pension fund kept stubbornly growing......As Putin tried to explain, male life expectancy in Russia was lower than in Western Europe because there was a higher death rate among younger men due to alcoholism and drugs, accidents and a rickety health system. Men who reached the age of 65 were likely to live, on average, another 14 years, only four years less than the OECD average......Putin himself had admitted a few months earlier that the state could have continued to finance the Pension Fund deficit for ‘another seven to ten years’ before the strain became intolerable.

- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**In October 2019, Aleksei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation was declared a foreign agent. Navalny had come up with a new tactic, which he called ‘smart voting’. If no ‘non-system’ candidate was allowed to stand, his supporters would vote for whoever had the best chance of defeating the candidate of United Russia, Putin’s party.....The combination of ‘smart voting’ and the steady drip of sensational exposés of corruption by highly placed officials exasperated Putin. Sometime towards the end of 2019 or early in 2020, he decided that, one way or another, Navalny would have to go....The following summer, the opposition leader travelled across Russia, mobilising his supporters for the regional elections which were to take place in September. On the morning of Thursday, August 20, he was in Tomsk, in Siberia, where he boarded a plane of the domestic Russian airline, S7, to fly back to Moscow. Half an hour after take-off, he began to experience a strange feeling which he had difficulty describing – not so much pain, he said later, but ‘as if the life were being sucked out of me’. He managed to walk to the lavatory before collapsing, groaning uncontrollably. The pilot diverted to Omsk and radioed ahead for an ambulance. By the time they landed, Navalny was in a coma. He was later flown to Berlin, where it was found that he had been poisoned with a cholinesterase inhibitor, subsequently identified as a nerve agent of the Novichok group, similar to that used against Sergei Skripal in Salisbury....Navalny remained in a coma for a month. The German doctors said afterwards that the good sense of the ambulance crew at Omsk, who gave him atropine, an anticholinergic drug used as an antidote against certain forms of poisoning, coupled with the quick reaction of the pilot, had almost certainly saved his life....Navalny had been attacked before by FSB agents or people acting on their behalf. This time was different...The complexity of the planning, the number of people involved and the sophistication of the substance used, all indicated that it had been authorised at a very high level. A team of FSB agents had been tracking Navalny’s movements since the beginning of the year.56 In Tomsk, they had entered his hotel room while he was out and smeared Novichok on articles of clothing. An FSB chemical-weapons specialist had afterwards been sent to recover the contaminated items.**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**The question was whether he himself had ordered Navalny killed or whether, given the ‘hands off’ mode in which he had been running Russia since the middle of his third term, the final decision had been taken by siloviki in his inner circle who assumed that he would be only too glad to see his long-time adversary removed....Even among Russians opposed to the regime, many thought the latter was more likely. Yet there are good grounds for thinking that Putin himself took the decision. His antipathy towards Navalny was personal. He refused to utter Navalny’s name, speaking instead of ‘the Berlin patient’, ‘this person’ or ‘this gentleman’.**"*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**But there is another, more compelling, reason to think that Putin personally approved the attack on Navalny. It crossed a line....Many in the United States and Europe are convinced that Putin has been behind every high-profile killing in Russia for the last 20 years....“The problem with that list, to which at least another dozen names could easily be added, was that, with the exception of Litvinenko, none had been killed at Putin’s behest. In a number of cases, he had been complicit in the cover-up that followed and he bore indirect responsibility by permitting a climate of impunity in which powerful figures could do as they wished. But that was not the same as directly ordering the death of a political opponent....The attempted murder of Navalny was the first time since Stalin’s day that a Russian ruler had organised the assassination of a rival. It was too strong a taboo to have been broken without Putin’s authorisation...A few years earlier, Putin had been asked by a group of students whether he believed that the end justified the means. ‘No,’ he said. ‘If you use some appalling means to reach your goal, you actually destroy the very goal you live for.’ Then he paused and added a qualification: ‘Not always.’ There might be exceptions. The need to eliminate Navalny from the political arena, to clear the way for the Duma elections due the following autumn and for whatever political transition might follow, was evidently in the ‘not always’ category....Putin had been hoping that Navalny would stay in the West, as Khodorkovsky and Berezovsky had done, in which case, as an émigré, his appeal to Russians would fade. Instead, he decided to follow the path traced by Nelson Mandela, hoping that a sojourn in prison would enhance his status and make him the undisputed standard-bearer of all who opposed the regime....The result was a political fight in which neither side gave quarter. When Navalny flew back to Moscow in January 2021, he was arrested on arrival.**."*
- ❗❗❗📝 *"...**In February, the suspension of Navalny’s jail sentence in the Yves Rocher case was revoked and he was sent to a penal colony, 60 miles east of Moscow. Political prisoners were isolated, woken every hour during the night, forbidden eye contact with guards and made to do repetitive, meaningless tasks. After a month, Navalny went on hunger strike in protest against the authorities’ refusal to let him have medical treatment. Three weeks later, on Putin’s instructions, they backed down. So long as he was in prison, there was nothing to be gained by pushing the situation to extremes. His suspended five-year sentence in the KirovLes case was still pending. As Khodorkovsky had discovered, a prisoner who crossed Putin could be detained for as long as the authorities desired....After Navalny ended his hunger strike, the West largely lost interest. So did most Russians...Despite all he had been through, Navalny remained more a gadfly than a national leader. But he was the only opposition figure with the charisma to bring large crowds of protesters out onto the streets and he had the potential to develop into a bigger threat.**."*

- ❗📝 *"...**Moscow’s relations with the Biden administration began warily. Putin waited almost six weeks after the November 2020 election, twice as long as even the Chinese, before congratulating Biden on his victory. Four years earlier, he had sent a warm message to Trump the following morning. It was a signal that Russia was in no hurry to seek an accommodation...Asked in mid December how he envisaged relations with the new President, Putin said, ‘I don’t know … It all depends who makes up his team.’ By then, it had been announced that Anthony Blinken would become Secretary of State with Victoria Nuland as his deputy. In Moscow, both were viewed as Russia hawks...Biden was asked whether he thought Putin was a killer. ‘I do,’ he replied. It was a way to underline his difference from Trump, who, when asked the same question, had answered: ‘There are a lot of killers … You think our country is so innocent?’ – an acknowledgement of moral equivalence which had infuriated many Americans. Biden went on to recall that, when he had met Putin as Vice President, ten years earlier, he had referred to George W. Bush’s much maligned remark about having looked into Putin’s eyes and ‘got a sense of his soul’. Biden said he had told him: ‘When I look into your eyes, I don’t think you have a soul.’ Putin, he said, had responded: ‘We understand each other.'**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**In reality, behind the macho rhetoric and public grandstanding, the relationship had got off to a much less rocky start than it had been made to appear. Four days after Biden’s inauguration, on January 25, 2021, the two countries had agreed to a five-year extension of New START, the only arms control agreement still in force after the cascade of unilateral American withdrawals during the George W. Bush and Trump presidencies. For the Russians, and for America, that was of vital importance. The following day Biden had telephoned Putin, and although they spent much of their time rehearsing their disagreements, the fact that he had taken the initiative was seen in Moscow as a positive sign. In March, when the White House finally got round to imposing sanctions on Russia for Navalny’s poisoning, they were the strict minimum. Two months later, Biden announced that the United States would waive threatened countermeasures against companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, a project which had been fiercely opposed by both the Obama and Trump administrations. It was made clear that the United States had not abandoned its reservations but that it would “no longer try to enforce them.**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**While Putin avoided criticising Trump in public – no one, after all, could be sure that he would not return to power in 2024 – the key consideration from the Kremlin’s standpoint was that Moscow now had a more rational, less impulsive partner in Washington. ‘Predictability and stability are the most important values in international affairs,’ Putin told an American journalist in June. He hoped, he added, that there would be no more ‘knee-jerk reactions’ and that relations from now on would be based on ‘defined rules of engagement’....Another telling clue to his attitude came when he was asked whether it was true that Biden had once told him that he had no soul. Putin was nothing if not thorough. He had certainly reviewed the transcript of their March 2011 conversation and knew exactly what had been said. But instead of giving a straight answer, he played with the question like a cat with a mouse. ‘I’m not sure,’ he said. ‘One has to think what a soul is. To be honest with you, I just don’t remember that particular bit of the conversation … There must be something wrong with my memory.’ It read like a coded message: ‘I know exactly what was said, but I won’t let on. It will remain between us. On that basis, if you wish, we can do business together.'**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**There was only one thing which did not quite fit. In early February, US intelligence had begun reporting a build-up of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border. By April, it became clear that it was the biggest concentration of Russian ground troops in the area since 2015. Russian officials, including Dmitry Kozak, the deputy head of the Presidential Administration who had taken over responsibility for Ukraine from Vladislav Surkov, began issuing ominous warnings that Moscow would not stand idly by if Kyiv moved against the separatists in the Donbas....The consensus in Western chancelleries was that it was essentially Russian muscle-flexing. The fact that the build-up had been carried out so openly suggested that the Kremlin’s goal was to get the Americans’ attention, rather than to prepare an invasion. But no one could be sure.**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**Biden opened by saying that he expected the two countries to conduct themselves as befitted ‘two great powers’ – a way of dissociating himself from Obama’s caustic dismissal of Russia as just ‘a regional power’. ‘We will try to determine where we have mutual interests and we can cooperate,’ he went on, ‘and where we don’t, [we will] establish a predictable and rational way [to deal with the issues] on which we disagree.’....Putin described their two hours of talks as ‘very constructive’, ‘fruitful’ and, at times, marked by ‘flashes of trust’ which, while positive, implied that for most of the discussion trust had been in short supply. Each side set out its red lines: for the United States, an end to Russian election interference; for Russia, no move by NATO to extend its influence further to the East. It was agreed that the two ambassadors should return to their posts and that a ‘Strategic Stability Dialogue’ should begin at ministerial level to ‘lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures’....Journalists on both sides wrote of a return to the way relations had been conducted during the Cold War, when Moscow and Washington had kept national security matters separate from other issues. It seemed that the relationship with the new administration in Washington had got off to a better start than anyone had expected.**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**'How long I remain in power will depend … on the specific situation in the world, in the country, and my own feelings about it.’...In the summer of 2021, the situation in the world, seen from Moscow, was more favourable than for a long time past. Under Biden, the United States had started to take seriously Russian concerns which until then it had refused to discuss, notably in the field of arms control. Moscow’s relations with China were stronger that they had ever been. In the Middle East, in Africa and the Arctic, Russia had reasserted itself as a power the United States had to reckon with. In Western Europe, Ukraine fatigue had set in. The main European powers – France, Germany, Italy and Spain – were reluctant to see their ties with Russia held indefinitely hostage to Crimea and the situation in the Donbas, and were open to discreet moves towards a more normal relationship. Britain was an outlier......But since leaving the European Union, London’s usefulness to America and its importance to Moscow had diminished. Moreover, with the West wanting to focus attention on China, the Kremlin might hope that European solidarity against Russia would gradually erode. During the Cold War, the threat of nuclear conflict had kept the United States and Western Europe on the same page. That time seemed to be past.**."*

Instead of focusing on Russia’s future, he spent more and more time thinking about the past.**"*

[Instead of] a single policy, there is chaos.'...It was not that Putin had lost his grip. But, except in foreign policy, he seemed to have no appetite to exert it....Being President was wearisome work. ‘Sometimes,’ Putin complained, ‘you have the feeling that you’re ceasing to be a human being and turning into just a function.’...A move to a less front-line role would be a logical continuation of the gradual disengagement that had begun after his re-election in 2018. There were hints that he was thinking along those lines. Yet he seemed genuinely torn. When he had said that a dual system of rule would be ‘absolutely ruinous’ for Russia, he meant it. He had not enjoyed the four years that he had spent ruling in tandem with Medvedev. But retiring altogether as Yeltsin had done did not appeal to him either. If he stayed on after stepping down as President, he had told an interviewer, ‘the question is: in what capacity? Right now, I have no answer.'**."*
- ❗❗❗❗❗❗📝 *"...**There was just one piece of unfinished business: Ukraine.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**As long as the frozen conflict in the East continued, Ukrainian membership of NATO was ruled out. But it did not prevent Ukrainian territory becoming, for all practical purposes, an extension of the Western alliance. For Putin, that situation was untenable. Less than a week after his meeting with Biden, the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, keen to show that post-Brexit Britain was still a force to be reckoned with, sent a destroyer through Crimean waters to demonstrate the West’s refusal to recognise Russian sovereignty. 
hat would the West have done, Putin mused afterwards, if Russia had sunk the British ship? Not much, he thought. No one would risk all-out war, because such a war could not be won....At the time, the prospect of a wider conflict over Ukraine appeared remote. Yet here was Putin saying that, were one to occur, the West would be unable to respond militarily for fear of provoking a nuclear riposte....Three weeks later, he published a long article entitled, ‘On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians’. Much of it restated well-worn themes. Ukrainians and Russians were in reality one people; Ukrainians’ sense of national identity stemmed mainly from the errors of the Bolsheviks, who, by introducing a federal system, had ‘chopped Russia into pieces’; the West was now exploiting this ‘to undermine our unity’ – and more in the same vein. But Putin then went on to deliver a message which went significantly further than anything he had said before. Ukraine, he declared, had become ‘a willing hostage to someone else’s geopolitical will’. It was being turned into a ‘springboard against Russia’, an ‘aggressive state’ whose armed forces were supervised by Western advisers and whose territory was being used for the deployment of NATO infrastructure. Russia would never accept that, Putin warned. ‘We will never allow our historical territories … to be used against [us]. To those who will undertake such an attempt, I would like to say that this way they will destroy their own country.'**."*

- 🌎📌 *"....**It was not a problem between Moscow and Kyiv, it was a problem between Russia and America and it would be up to Moscow and Washington to resolve it...Although few realised it at the time, the article signalled a change in Putin’s thinking....It was now becoming an obsession. Had Trump remained in office, Putin might well have been more cautious. Trump was already undermining NATO without Moscow’s help. Moreover, he was unpredictable and, for all his vaunted admiration of Putin, was capable, if challenged, of lashing out recklessly with disastrous consequences. Biden was a much steadier pair of hands. Ukraine was a useful pressure point, as had been shown by the administration’s decision to hold early talks in Geneva. Putin’s takeaway from that meeting had been that America would seek to avoid needless conflict with Russia. The challenge of the future was China; Russia was not exactly a distraction but it was no longer America’s main foe. If a different president were elected in 2024, that might change....As Putin weighed his options that summer, there appeared to be a window of opportunity for one last push to bring Ukraine to heel. It would be a gamble. But if he could carry it off, correcting what he viewed as one of the cardinal sins of his predecessors, it would be the crowning achievement of his career – the last box to check before embarking on a political transition at home, allowing him to leave office on a high note.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**He wanted ‘concrete agreements that rule out any further eastward expansion of NATO and the deployment of weapons systems posing a threat to us in close proximity to Russia’s territory’. Given the West’s failure to honour its earlier commitments in this regard, he added – a reference to James Baker’s promise in 1990 that NATO would move ‘not an inch’ to the east – there would need to be ‘precise, legal, juridical guarantees’.112 Verbal assurances would not be enough...When, as Putin had anticipated, the United States declined to negotiate on that basis, the pressure on Kyiv intensified. The Biden administration began warning publicly of the likelihood of a Russian invasion and promised that, if that happened, it would arm Ukrainian insurgents to turn the country into a ‘porcupine’ which Moscow would be unable to swallow. However the US President also said that he would not send troops to defend Ukraine since it was not a NATO member....But to Putin it confirmed that his instincts had been correct. There would be no risk of direct Western military intervention. At most, NATO would provide weapons and encourage the Ukrainians to fight Russia in its stead. There would be economic sanctions, too, but the Kremlin had been living with sanctions for eight years, ever since the annexation of Crimea.....In a joint communiqué, he and Xi Jinping called for an end to NATO expansion and declared that their countries’ friendship had ‘no limit'.**"*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Eventually Ukraine would join NATO and its territory would become ‘an advanced bridgehead for a [pre-emptive] strike’ against Russia. There was no longer any point in hoping for a peaceful settlement through the Minsk accords – those agreements were dead. For Russians, particularly of the older generation, Putin’s allegations resonated. In the West, they appeared malign and surreal.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Two days later, at dawn on February 24, Putin announced the invasion...Russia had no choice but to defend itself, he said, because ‘irresponsible Western politicians’ had ‘rudely and unceremoniously’ pushed NATO’s military infrastructure up to its borders: 'Where did this insolent manner of talking down to us from the height of their exceptionalism … come from? What is the explanation for their contemptuous, disdainful attitude? … The answer is simple … In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union grew weaker and subsequently broke apart. [In the West] there was a state of euphoria, a feeling of absolute superiority … They deceived us, or, to put it simply, they duped us [like] a con artist … The whole so-called Western bloc, formed by the United States in its own image, is … an ‘empire of lies’.'**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**In the West and in Russia, the war was met with disbelief. Most Europeans – and much of the Russian intelligentsia – thought Putin had taken leave of his senses. There was speculation that his long isolation during the pandemic had affected his judgement.....The theatricality was a giveaway. It was Putin’s version of Richard Nixon’s ‘madman’ theory, intended to make him appear so irrational and unpredictable that adversaries would hesitate before testing his resolve. To ram the message home, he warned that any attempt to intervene would bring ‘consequences such as you have never seen in your entire history’ and announced that Russia’s nuclear forces had been placed on full alert. That turned out to be untrue: the Americans said later there had been no change in Russia’s nuclear force posture. Stripped of the angry rhetoric, it was typical of the way Putin operated. Almost everyone had been blindsided. The United States, which was monitoring Russian military communications, had concluded, correctly, that an invasion was being planned.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Everyone else, including European governments as well as most Russians, had assumed that he was bluffing – which was why, in the days immediately following, some of Russia’s richest men, including members of Putin’s entourage, found their assets sequestrated and their mega-yachts impounded in European ports. To them, the idea that Russia would launch a full-scale land war against Ukraine had seemed unthinkable. To Putin, it made perfect sense. For centuries in Europe, war had been an extension of diplomacy. After World War II, Europeans had assumed a little too readily that all that was behind them........Russia’s use of force, he thought, was different. It was justified because it was the only way to make the United States take Moscow’s concerns seriously.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Western governments and their advisers struggled to understand Putin’s reasoning....thought it was ‘essentially a post-colonial land grab’. But Russia already had more territory than it knew what to do with. Grabbing more land for its own sake served no purpose. The State Department insisted that the war had nothing to do with NATO enlargement and everything to do with Putin’s refusal to accept Ukraine’s existence as an independent state, which may have been good spin but was poor history...Others speculated that Putin was unable to stomach the thought of a democratic government in Kyiv which might lead Russians to reject his own, autocratic form of rule. But that was tantamount to saying that all that prevented Russia from becoming a Western-style democracy was Putin and the kleptocrats supporting him. Much as the West might wish that to be true, it was not the case..**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**The decision to invade, far from being aberrant, was consistent with the way he had acted before. Throughout Putin’s time in office, whenever he was faced with what he saw as an existential choice between antagonising the West and preserving his own power and Russia’s position in the world, the latter always prevailed. In 2003, he had ordered the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky because nipping in the bud the political ambitions of the business elite was more important than the loss of Western investment. In 2014, he occupied Crimea and backed the creation of rump protectorates in Donetsk and Luhansk because safeguarding the Black Sea Fleet’s base at Sevastopol and keeping Ukraine out of NATO were more important than Western sanctions. In each case, Putin accepted the economic damage to Russia as a price that had to be paid...In 2022, the invasion of Ukraine followed the same pattern.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Even the Pentagon believed that Kyiv would fall in a matter of days. Putin assumed that Zelensky would then flee, the Kremlin would be able to install a puppet government and Ukraine would be politically and militarily neutralised...But that was not the only goal. In addition to returning Ukraine to Moscow’s sphere of influence, Putin wanted to show that the United States was powerless to prevent it....As the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, put it: ‘This is not actually, or at least, not primarily, about Ukraine at all … It reflects the battle over what the [future] world order will look like. Will it be a world in which the West will lead everyone with impunity and without question or will it be something different?'....Putin believed that if Russia succeeded, it would fatally undermine the structures of European security which had been built up under American leadership since the end of the Cold War....but it gave pause to leaders in Eastern Europe. Would America really risk nuclear annihilation to defend Warsaw or Tallinn? The question was not new but the invasion of Ukraine put it in a harshly different light. To Putin, even if Russia had failed to prevent NATO enlargement, it might yet sow doubt about the alliance’s reliability, undermining faith in America’s support for other states on Russia’s borders, NATO members or not.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**America’s goal, said the National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, was ‘a free and independent Ukraine, a weakened and isolated Russia and a stronger, more unified West’...The West was returning to the old policies of containment that it had practised during the Cold War, but this time with a more radical objective: not merely to contain Russia but to leave it so diminished that it could never threaten its neighbours again.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**No war works out as planned and Putin’s was no exception...They had known from their experience in the Donbas over the previous eight years that the Ukrainian army would fight back. But they had not anticipated such fierce resistance. The US, Britain and Canada had been training Ukrainian forces since 2015 for just this kind of eventuality and it showed...Instead of remaining passive, Ukrainians of all ages volunteered to join home defence detachments. Others acted as scouts and sent back information on the Russians’ positions. President Zelensky, far from fleeing the country as Putin had expected, proved an inspirational wartime leader. The close ties between the two peoples – more than 40 per cent of Ukrainians have relatives in Russia131 – also played a part, though not in the sense that Moscow had hoped. The conflict was fratricidal – not quite a civil war, but close – with all the emotional intensity that characterises such conflicts. In the regions bearing the brunt of the fighting, bordering the Donbas in eastern and south-eastern Ukraine, which before the war had been largely sympathetic to Russia, much of the population went over to supporting Kyiv.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Putin’s biggest mistake was his refusal to accept that Ukrainians and Russians, although closely related, are not one people but distinct Slav nations, each of which cleaves to its own national identity. His second, scarcely less serious, miscalculation was to overestimate the capabilities of his armed forces....Initially the Russian forces were under strict orders to spare the civilian population, which led to bizarre scenes as miles-long Russian armoured columns halted at traffic lights to allow Ukrainian motorists to pass....As Ukrainian resistance intensified, the local population became the enemy.....The atrocities that marked the opening months of the war were not on the same scale as in Yugoslavia, where, thirty years earlier, 150,000 people had been killed, many of them dying in spasms of ethnic cleansing that bore the hallmarks of genocide, nor were they as systematic as in Chechnya or Syria. Cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv were not reduced to rubble, as Grozny and Aleppo had been, a degree of restraint which puzzled Western military analysts as well as many Russians, who wondered why their army was being asked to fight ‘with one hand tied behind its back’.... Mariupol was an exception because it controlled the land bridge between the Donbas and Crimea and the Russians were determined to take it no matter what the cost....In Crimea in 2014, the special forces, better equipped and better trained than regular troops, had impressed Western observers by their discipline. But they had met no resistance. Eight years later, the war in Ukraine showed that, despite a modernisation programme costing billions of dollars, the Russian army was still a blunt instrument, parts of which would revert to savagery when faced with serious opposition.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**In the first two-and-a-half months, the Russian expeditionary force was said to have lost up to 15,000 soldiers killed and perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 wounded – more than all the American casualties in 20 years’ fighting in Afghanistan. Thousands of Ukrainians died, a quarter of the population was displaced and more than five million fled the country as refugees....Ukraine writhed in torment but fought back...The West responded not with half-measures as in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea but by pouring in arms supplies and imposing unprecedented economic sanctions.**"*
- 🌎📌 *"....**In the West, there was a broad consensus that Putin had made a fatal error. The progress of the war seemed to confirm that. After six weeks, the Russians withdrew from Kyiv, apparently abandoning hopes of regime change and regrouping for the more limited objective of securing the Donbas and the land bridge to Crimea....President Zelensky, who, earlier in the conflict, had proposed, in return for a peace agreement, Ukrainian neutrality and an end to the country’s NATO ambitions, now pledged never to give up an inch of Ukrainian territory and spoke of driving out the Russians altogether...However the situation was more complicated than those optimistic readouts made it appear...British and American commentators initially sought to portray the conflict as ‘the world against Russia’. It soon became clear that in fact it was ‘the West against Russia’. Among the ten largest countries, only one – the United States – unequivocally supported Ukraine. The others, representing between them more than half the world’s population, either supported Moscow or sat on the fence...Had the Biden administration focused on the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity – a principle on which all countries could agree – the tally might have been different. By framing it as a struggle between democracy and autocracy, the White House rebuffed countries with autocratic regimes which might otherwise have been supportive.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Even within NATO, where at first sight the war created a renewed sense of unity and common purpose and Finland and Sweden announced that they envisaged membership, there were fissures beneath the surface. ‘Old Europe’ and ‘New Europe’, as Donald Rumsfeld had called them, had very different agendas. Poland, the Baltic States, the Czech Republic and Slovakia took a maximalist position, holding that Russia only understood the language of force and Europe would not be safe until it had been decisively defeated. Britain played the role of cheerleader. France, Germany, Italy and Spain looked more soberly to the day when peace would be restored and relations would have somehow to be repaired.....Producing fractures of this kind, globally and within Europe, had been one of Putin’s aims. As the economic fallout from the conflict mounted, such divisions, he thought, would become more pronounced. How would Europeans react, Russian officials gloated, when faced with sharply higher inflation, shortages of energy and basic foodstuffs? How long would Europe’s welcome last if millions of Ukrainian refugees stayed on indefinitely? What would happen if hunger in Africa and the Middle East brought fresh waves of migrants towards Europe’s shores? When the war eventually ended, who would pay the half trillion US dollars or more that Ukraine’s reconstruction would need?**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**If Western leaders had hoped that economic pressure would turn Russians against Putin’s regime, they were disappointed. Sanctions are a double-edged sword. In the first months, most Russians saw little change in their everyday lives. The rich resigned themselves to holidaying in Dubai rather than on the Côte d’Azur. The poor had their income protected by government subsidies. The rouble kept its value. The Russian economy did not collapse. Everyone understood that more difficult times lay ahead. One leading Russian economist described the state support measures as ‘putting cosmetics on a corpse’. But sanctions reinforced the Kremlin’s narrative that the West was determined to bring Russia to its knees and every patriotic citizen was duty bound to resist. Private Western initiatives to condemn the Russian invasion had a similar effect. Banning Russian tennis players from Wimbledon, renaming Degas’s ‘Russian Dancers’ as ‘Ukrainian Dancers’, suspending Russian opera singers and cancelling concerts of Russian music, however virtuous such decisions might seem to those responsible, gave Russians the impression that all of them, even those most opposed to their government’s actions, were irrevocably tarred with collective guilt.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**While the war continued, Putin’s plans for a transfer of power in Russia were put on hold, to be revived or not, depending on the outcome, once the conflict had played out...However it eventuated, there was a palpable sense that an era had ended. The three decades since the Cold War in which the United States had been the uncontested superpower were over. Beijing was challenging American supremacy in the South China Sea. Russia, with Chinese backing, was contesting American power in Europe. What would follow was uncertain. A new geopolitical reality would emerge, but what form it would take, no one could predict.**."*
- *Afterword* -  🌎📌 *"....**Anyone, Russian or foreigner, who reflects on Russia’s situation after more than 20 years of Putin’s rule, is bound to wonder: Did it have to be this way? Was the drift towards authoritarianism preordained? Were Russia’s relations with the West fated from the outset to decline into mutual hostility and conflict or could that have been avoided?......Unfortunately, they generate much heat and very little light. Russia today is what it is and its relations with the West are what they are, not what others might wish them to be.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**A common view, especially in the United States but in much of Europe as well, is that ‘Russia is under the thumb of a brutal dictator no different from the communists’. Until the war in Ukraine, that was a gross oversimplification. For most Russians, even after the crackdown on the opposition in 2021, life was far less bleak than it was painted in the West. Despite glaring inequalities, living standards had risen across the board. Crony capitalism and corruption were rampant and growth had stalled after the recession of 2008. Nonetheless, the economy had doubled in size under Putin’s stewardship and the population as a whole lived better than at any time in the past. The share of oil and gas in GDP had been significantly reduced. Agriculture, which Mikhail Gorbachev used to say had been a disaster ever since 1917, was booming. Where in Soviet times, Russia imported food, farm exports were bringing in more money than arms sales.......Since the war in Ukraine, much of that has since changed for the worse. Many of the achievements of Putin’s first three terms risk being lost. Yet even amid war and economic reprisals by the West, the quality of life for most Russians bears little resemblance to what it was in the early 1990s, let alone under communist rule. The modernisation of Russia’s armed forces, which had been touted as one of Putin’s great achievements, has turned out to be far less impressive than had been claimed. Nonetheless, by fair means and foul, Russia has reasserted itself as a major actor in international affairs whose voice cannot be ignored.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**The question is not whether Russia could have taken a different path. It is why Russia – and Putin – took the path they did and where the country will go from here.The seminal decisions, which have helped to determine Russia’s course ever since, were taken in the 1990s. The Yeltsin constitution established a presidential republic in which parliament played a secondary role. The privatisation of state-owned industry and natural resources to well-connected insiders at fire-sale prices – a programme inspired by the doctrines of the Chicago school and enthusiastically supported by American advisers – created an economic base not that different from that built by Henry Ford, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, Rockefeller and Pierpoint Morgan in America a century earlier.....In both cases – the creation of a powerful presidency and of an oligarchy detested by the general population as much as the US robber barons ever were – Yeltsin and his advisers believed there was no alternative. They may well have been right. But whether right or wrong, those were the choices they made.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**The Clinton administration and its European allies also took two key decisions which had a lasting effect on developments within Russia and on its relations with the West. The first was to hold off from providing large-scale financial aid after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The second was to offer NATO membership to the former Warsaw Pact states of Central and Eastern Europe....To policy-makers in Washington, those choices seemed entirely logical....Yeltsin’s Russia was so dysfunctional, they argued, that giving Moscow economic aid would amount to pouring it down a black hole. The Russian state had first to get itself in order. Only then could economic assistance make any real difference. Accordingly, the West gave far more aid to Poland, a country with a quarter of Russia’s population, than it did to Moscow.........In the same way, NATO expansion was seen as necessary to bind the newly liberated Eastern European states to the West and ensure that Russia would never subjugate them again. That, too, can be questioned, but it was what was decided.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Russians saw things very differently......From their perspective, they had abandoned communism, embraced what until then they had disparaged as ‘bourgeois democracy’, begun the painful transition to a market economy and accepted such un-Russian ideas as individual property ownership and a multiparty political system, yet instead of welcoming them back like the prodigal sons they were, the United States and its allies had kept them at arm’s length. They felt cheated. America, far from being the role model and strategic partner that they had hoped, seemed bent on keeping Russia down. NATO enlargement was incomprehensible. Russian leaders throughout history had feared invasion from the West. Both Napoleon and Hitler had sent their armies that way. If the West meant well, why was it moving its troops closer and closer to Russia’s borders?**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Americans could not see that. The Cold War was over, they said. A new era had been born, a new world order in which everyone was on the same side. What was there for Russia to worry about?.....To the Kremlin, that was hypocrisy. Politics the American way had always been a zero-sum game. The Cold War had indeed ended. Russia had lost. The West had won......It is not difficult to make a case that the West, as the stronger partner, bears most of the responsibility for the failure to establish normal relations after the Soviet Union’s collapse. At a time when Russia was on its knees, many Western leaders, not only in the United States, concluded myopically that it was finished and would never again be a major power. It was for the West to set the rules, they argued. Russian sensitivities could be ignored. Until the Ukraine crisis in 2014 and Putin’s intervention in Syria, the following year, the United States was proactive, Russia reactive......it launched a democracy promotion campaign to spread its values and political beliefs to Russia and the rest of the world.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**None of that should have been a surprise. The United States was merely doing what great powers always do. Strong countries lay down the law and demand that defeated opponents follow. After World War II, former enemies like Germany and Japan became America’s allies. Russia was expected to do something similar....For a number of reasons, that did not happen.....Russia was too huge to fit into the Western alliance. It had been the West’s main adversary for half a century, whereas Germany and Japan had only briefly been America’s enemies. Unlike the Axis powers, Russia had not been defeated in war and retained a formidable nuclear arsenal. Military establishments do not turn on a dime: deeply entrenched attitudes take generations to change. NATO enlargement was an insurance policy as well as a way to project American power.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**He believed that Russia’s destiny was as a European state. Culturally, economically and politically, Europe was where it belonged.....George W. Bush welcomed that. But, like Clinton, Bush saw Russia’s future as part of an American-led world....Putin did not.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**this would always have been a fundamental stumbling block to the establishment of normal ties. In that sense there was an inevitability about the way the relationship developed. It was largely the result of a series of Western, essentially American, decisions. But for the United States to have acted differently would have required an effort of statesmanship and far-sightedness, calling into question basic assumptions about America’s role in the world, of which no American leader was capable. The chain of cause and effect, starting in the 1990s, that has led to the present state of affairs, could doubtless have taken other forms. But it is unlikely that the end result would have been significantly different, because the historical forces driving it would have remained the same....America, the dominant global power, believes that its role is to lead. Russia refuses to be led....The United States’ belief in its own exceptionalism has not helped. If a nation regards itself as exceptional, it cannot, by definition, accept others as equals. Russia demanded equality and its corollary, respect.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**As relations with the West worsened, pro-Western liberals in Russia were excluded from decision-making.....Liberal democracy has shallow roots in Russia. In some ways, the most remarkable thing about the early 2000s was not that Putin sought to restrict it but that it survived at all. However, the result has been a vicious circle. As relations with the West have deteriorated, the influence of the siloviki and other conservatives has increased, further eroding democratic freedoms and making relations with the West still worse.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**If it is relatively straightforward to see how the present state of affairs in Russia has arisen, it is far harder to describe what may happen next. Anyone who tries to peer into the future, in Russia or anywhere else, is on a hiding to nothing. But history – the history which failed to ‘end’ after the Soviet Union’s collapse but instead came roaring back – offers a few clues.....whoever succeeds Putin – whether an individual or a collective leadership – is unlikely to put Russia on a fundamentally different course, either at home or abroad.......Russians grumble because their expectations are not being met. But the majority have too much to lose to want to risk another tectonic upheaval.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Whatever happens in the short term, within the next 10 to 15 years power will pass to a generation of Russians who grew up after the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Their attitudes and their sense of Russia’s place in the world are very different from those of their parents’ generation. They will be faced with the tasks that Putin has left undone. His principal achievements have been the reassertion of Russia’s military power and political cohesion. In the coming decades, Russia’s international status will depend less on its military and its diplomats and more on the success or failure of its domestic transformation. For his successors, the key challenges will be structural reform, technological innovation and diversification away from oil and gas exports to take account of climate change, which could force a radical reshaping of the Russian economy as early as the 2030s**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**In most countries, foreign policy is driven by domestic considerations, not the other way round. In Russia for most of the past century, the opposite has been true. Under Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev, as well as their successors, Russian domestic policy has been heavily influenced by ties with the West. In the years ahead, the shifting relations between the world’s ‘Big Three’ – America, China and Russia – will be a crucial variable.......sooner or later Xi Jinping’s China would have sought nuclear parity whatever America did – it will alter fundamentally the contours of the great power triangle.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**A shift in American policy to focus on China’s growing strength will affect the West’s relations with Russia which in turn will influence Russian domestic policies. It has been a constant of Russian politics for at least the last century that a less adversarial relationship with the West translates into greater freedoms at home.......Other global challenges may also intervene. Apart from climate change, they include greatly increased economic migration and, possibly, a new and deadlier zoonotic pandemic. If any of these were to become critical, the present divisions between the world’s great powers might become less relevant. As Putin himself put it, ‘in such conditions, geopolitical [and] ideological rivalry loses its meaning’. It has happened before. During the Second World War, Russia and the Western powers cast aside their political and ideological differences to join forces against the common threat from Nazi Germany........The Covid-19 pandemic, far from promoting unity, exacerbated existing divisions. Even if something of this kind does occur, its effects may well be marginal. But it cannot be ruled out altogether.**."*
- 🌎📌 *"....**Russia is used to playing a long game. Just as Putin is convinced that one day, despite the war, Moscow and Kyiv will overcome their differences, he believes that America and Russia will eventually settle into a less contentious relationship. In the long term, he is no doubt right, the only uncertainty being how long it will take. The maxim that countries have permanent interests, but no permanent friends or enemies, remains as true today as when Lord Palmerston coined it in 1848.....It would be wrong, therefore, to regard the current hostility between Russia and the West as for ever fixed. But in the meantime, Russia will remain an awkward bedfellow. An unimaginably vast country, suspended across the top of the world between Europe and Asia, its history is profoundly different from that of its European cousins, yet its people are formed in exactly the same mould. That is part of the problem. Family quarrels are often the most intractable. Russians not only look like Europeans, they are Europeans and are expected to behave as the rest of the family does. Unaccountably, stubbornly, they refuse to do so. That will not soon change..**."*
