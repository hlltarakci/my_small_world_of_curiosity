    - *"Almost every language in use in the world today has a generally accepted form of transliteration into English. Russian does not. Although various romanisations exist, none has yet established itself as a universal standard, partly, perhaps, because most require special characters and diacritical marks. The result is a hodgepodge in which names are spelt in a bewildering variety of ways."*
    - *"Russian names always include the patronymic ‚Äì thus, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin; his father, Vladimir Spiridonovich; his grandfather, Spiridon Ivanovich, and so on, the middle name deriving from the father‚Äôs given name. The combination of forename and patronymic is the polite form of address, ‚ÄòVladimir Vladimirovich‚Äô in Russian being the equivalent of ‚ÄòMr Putin‚Äô in English."*

    - *"...several possibilities were being considered. Two involved changing the constitution, either to give greater independence to Russia‚Äôs 89 constituent regions, making the country a confederal rather than a federal state, or to consummate a long-discussed Union between Russia and Belarus, with Yeltsin as President and the Belarussian leader, Aleksandr Lukashenko, as Vice President. In either case, a new constitution would have to be written which would mean that the elections would be delayed. The third possibility, was to create a situation justifying the declaration of a state of emergency..."*
    - *"..'For the first time, responsibility for the bombings of the apartment buildings in Russia has been clearly [ascribed] to the presidential family and, personally, to the head of the government, Vladimir Putin, as the de facto sponsor and organiser of the explosions. This charge is too serious ‚Ä¶ to be ignored...In a country where, over the centuries, people have learnt to expect the worst from their rulers, and where the news media, not long freed from the iron grip of Soviet censorship, had a pronounced tendency to confuse fiction with fact, Russians reacted to these claims more phlegmatically than might have been expected...**Putin took charge of the war and the tough, no-nonsense manner in which he approached the conflict resonated with Russians.**."*
    - *"**..if the FSB, or even elements within it, had participated in the bombings, it would have been impossible to maintain secrecy for so long.**..**the British services had ‚Äòa lot of penetration‚Äô in Russia at that time. Had there been serious evidence of FSB participation, he says, MI6 would certainly have learnt of it.**...Shamil Basayev was quoted as saying after the first explosion in Moscow that it was ‚Äònot our work, but the work of the Dagestanis‚Äô. That was probably true but it was a nuance."*
    - *"..Berezovsky financed a television documentary, ‚ÄòThe Assassination of Russia‚Äô, and two books about the bombings, Blowing Up Russia and Lubyanskaya prestupnaya gruppirovka [‚ÄòThe Lubyanka Criminal Group‚Äô], co-authored by Aleksandr Litvinenko, a former FSB officer whose murder in London with radioactive polonium would later make worldwide headlines."*
    - *"..**The saga of the apartment bombings illustrates two of the main difficulties confronting anyone who seeks to penetrate the mysteries of Putin‚Äôs Russia."**..The first: **American tendency to view every enemy as ‚Äòa perfect model of malice, a kind of amoral superman ‚Äì sinister, ubiquitous, powerful, cruel ‚Ä¶ [who] profits from the misery he has produced.**.."*
    - [Putinversteher (*Russia-Empathizer*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putinversteher)
    - *"..To Russia, the relationship with America is far more important than any other. For much of the time since the 1950s, America regarded Russia the same way.. The two countries are antinomes, halves of a unique dyad which neither forms with any other nation. Both think of themselves as exceptional, which is a recipe for mutual incomprehension, if not animosity, no matter who occupies the Kremlin or the White House...**Europe follows America‚Äôs lead, though in less polarised fashion. Geographically, Europe is closer and more conscious of the need to find ways to coexist with its giant neighbour.**.."*
    - *"..**National leaders invariably reflect the societies from which they come, no matter how unpalatable that thought may be to the citizens of the countries concerned. Putin is no more an aberration in Russia than Donald Trump in America, Boris Johnson in Britain or Emmanuel Macron in France. He represents the hopes and fears, the aspirations and anguish, the conceits and resentments of a substantial part of the Russian population, who regularly support him. To try to work out why Putin behaves as he does, why under his tutelage Russia has become the country it is and what may lie ahead, both while he remains its leader and under his successors, it is necessary to put aside stereotypes and examine each piece of evidence for what it is, soberly and without prejudgement.**."*
    - *"..Normally a biographer‚Äôs task is to expound the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô and ‚Äòhow‚Äô of his subject‚Äôs life: the underlying facts are rarely in dispute. With Putin, that is often not the case. **As with the apartment bombings, widely accepted assumptions turn out on closer scrutiny to be partial, misleading or downright wrong. That is part of a long tradition in Russia.** Winston Churchill‚Äôs famous definition of Kremlinology as **watching ‚Äòa bulldog fight under a rug ‚Äì an outsider only hears the growling, and when he sees the bones fly out from beneath it is obvious who won‚Äô ‚Äì has been true of Russian governance since the sixteenth century or earlier.** **The Kremlin does not yield its secrets easily. The broad outline may be clear, but the devil is in the details and the details matter. If enough details change, the overall picture changes too.**.."*
    - *"..The purpose of this book..**to explore Putin's personality, to understand what motivates him and how he has become the leader that he is. It has no agenda other than to establish as fully and accurately as possible the facts of his life and career, his truths and his lies, his successes and failures and the context in which he operates, and to set them out with sufficient clarity for readers to be able to make an informed judgement themselves.**."*
    - Chapter 1 - Baskov Lane - *"...Putin‚Äôs early childhood was both cosseted and unusually free. Cosseted because, within the limits of what was possible for a working-class family in post-war Leningrad, his parents did everything they could for him; free because he was spared **the discipline of Soviet preschool education, where play was combined with collective responsibility and the teachers instilled simple precepts of morality that would not have been out of place in a Victorian dame school. Even three-year-olds were expected to help clean up after lessons, clear the tables and, in winter, clear away snow.**...At home, there was none of that. His mother taught him to read and write and learn his numbers, but when he was done, he could go out and play."*
    - *"...The school year in Russia starts on September 1, unless it happens to be at a weekend...‚ÄòFirst Bell Day‚Äô.."*
    - *"..As a schoolteacher I can say that you can divide parents into two groups: those who care and those who don‚Äôt. [Putin‚Äôs] school, School 193, was for kids from families which didn‚Äôt care.."*
    - *"..**In Russian schools, a child who misbehaved was punished by emotional pressure ‚Äì the teacher would act coldly and express disappointment ‚Äì rather than by physical correction, which was forbidden. The goal was to internalise obedience, so that the child would behave well not out of fear of retribution but to win the teacher‚Äôs, and his peers‚Äô, affection.** To Putin, who had been brought up at home, that was all very new and strange."*
    - *"..**The school rules, which every child had to learn by heart, enjoined them ‚Äònot to arrive late for classes; to sit upright during the lesson, not leaning on the elbows or slouching; to listen attentively ‚Ä¶ and not to let [their] attention wander to other things; to be respectful to the school director and teachers and, when meeting them, to greet them with a polite bow ‚Äì boys should also raise their caps; and to cherish the honour of school and defend it as their own.**."*
    - [Little Octobrists (–æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—èÃÅ—Ç–∞)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Octobrists)
    - *"..In later life, Putin wrote that he had been a hooligan as a child...'It wasn‚Äôt so much that conflicts sought him out, it was he who was always looking for conflicts.'...He had no fear. **He didn‚Äôt seem to have an inner instinct for self-preservation.** It never occurred to him that the other boy was stronger and might beat him up...**He wasn‚Äôt the strongest in our class, but in a fight he could beat anyone, because he would get into a frenzy and fight to the end.**...**he had ‚Äòboth aggressiveness and common sense. At first glance, it seems they are total opposites ‚Ä¶ But in fact, they complement each other.**...Although he showed little interest in his studies and was spurned by the Pioneers, his classmates respected him for his audacity and for the way he rushed to the defence of his friends."*
    - *"**Vladimir Putin grew up in a city more deeply scarred by the Second World War, or the Great Patriotic War, as Russians usually call it, than any outsider can begin to comprehend. For Americans in particular, whose country has never been invaded by a hostile power, and even for Western Europeans, who saw cities like Coventry, Dresden and Warsaw reduced to rubble, it is hard to grasp the enormity of what happened during the Leningrad blockade. After Hitler‚Äôs troops surrounded the city in September 1941, with orders not to occupy it but to let the population starve, three quarters of a million Leningraders perished, most of them in the famine winter of 1941‚Äì2, when Putin‚Äôs brother, Viktor, died, and the ration for dependants was reduced to a few ounces of ersatz bread a day. That was four times the death toll in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, and 35 times more than in the London Blitz. In this one Russian city, more people died than all the Americans who have died in every foreign war the United States has ever fought.**."*
    - *"In terms of physical damage, Leningrad suffered less than cities like Stalingrad or Smolensk or Novgorod, where hardly a single building was left standing. But the physical scars of war can be repaired. By the time Putin was born, most of the centre of the city had been rebuilt. **The psychological scars went far deeper. Each person reacted differently.** A few talked compulsively about what they had endured. But most, like Putin‚Äôs parents, buried it deep inside. As one blockade survivor put it, **memories of that time were ‚Äòa minefield within the mind. You only have to step on them and you blow up. Everything flies to hell ‚Äì quiet, comfort, present-day happiness.‚Äô** In Putin‚Äôs family, the war was discussed only when relatives who had spent the war years elsewhere came to visit. From listening to those conversations, Volodya began to understand what his parents had endured."*
    - *"..'One does not know what to marvel at more: the madness of those who gave the orders or the courage of those who carried them out.'..."*
    - *"...Putin told the story often, including to Hillary Clinton during a summit meeting in 2012. **The details changed at almost every telling. That does not make it untrue. Psychological research has shown that when traumatic events are recalled, recollections vary over time even when the person concerned was not a direct participant.**."*
    - *"...There had been cannibalism in the army, in the prisons and among the civilian population...But those were merely fleeting glimpses of a blockade which had lasted nearly 30 months..."*
    - *"..**Stalin saw the city, historically Russia‚Äôs gateway to the West, as a weak link in the new Iron Curtain. Leningrad‚Äôs artists and intellectuals were accused of ‚Äòcringing servility towards bourgeois culture‚Äô. A ferocious purge began, which coincided with renewed famine**, as the Soviet grain harvest was hit by drought and a distribution system wrecked by war proved unable to cope with the vast population movements that followed the German defeat."*
    - *"..But that year another purge started. Leningrad‚Äôs wartime leader, Andrei Zhdanov, who had been seen as Stalin‚Äôs probable successor, died of a heart attack, triggering a covert power struggle between the KGB Chief, Lavrenty Beria, and his rival, Georgy Malenkov. In what later became known as the Leningrad Affair, Zhdanov‚Äôs former colleagues were executed and some 2,000 other officials, reaching down to the level of factory Party Committees, were sent to labour camps. It was not the best time to try to start a family. **Russia, unlike Europe and America, had no post-war baby boom.**...A group of Jewish doctors had been accused of trying to kill the Soviet leadership in the so-called ‚ÄòDoctors‚Äô Plot‚Äô, which Stalin had concocted as justification for yet another massive purge."*
    - *"...**Privacy was unknown. Until quite recent times, the Russian language had no word for it. Communal living was a long-established tradition.**...It was primitive. **But Putin would say later that he ‚Äònever felt disadvantaged or miserable‚Äô.** It was the way everybody lived and the grown-ups had all known much worse."*
    - *"...The memory stayed with him, and years later he would draw the lesson: **‚ÄòNo one should be cornered. No one should be put in a situation where they have no way out.'**."*
    - *"...Khrushchev‚Äôs message was mixed: Lenin had been good but Stalin had been wicked; the system was correct but Stalin had betrayed it...The Secret Speech triggered unrest in Poland and an uprising in Hungary...The ‚ÄòKhrushchev Thaw‚Äô, as it was called, reached its apogee with the removal in 1961 of Stalin‚Äôs embalmed body from the mausoleum on Red Square, where he had lain in state beside Lenin, for reburial at the foot of the Kremlin Wall...Khrushchev held that a new world war was no longer inevitable, as Stalin had believed, but East and West could practise peaceful coexistence..."*
    - *"..**In Soviet schools in Stalin‚Äôs time, children were expected to be docile and unquestioning. Under Khrushchev, that changed. There was no return to the years immediately after 1917, when rebelliousness was seen as a revolutionary virtue. But children were once again encouraged to be more independent and assertive."**...Whether for this reason, or because he was now older and starting to think about what he wanted to do with his life, in 1965, when Volodya was twelve, his behaviour began to improve...Why he chose German rather than English, which was much more popular, he never explained: it may have been curiosity about the Soviet Union‚Äôs enemies in the war, a desire to do something different from the majority of his classmates or simply because he liked his new teacher...**Under the Soviet system, teachers were expected to work closely with families, especially when a child proved difficult and in need of extra help. If the family did not pull its weight, considerable pressure could be brought to bear, including criticism at mass meetings at the parents‚Äô places of work.**."*
    - *"..To maintain the kind of leadership I had,‚Äô he explained later, ‚Äòit needed real physical strength and skills. I wanted to keep that kind of leadership ‚Ä¶ I knew that if I didn‚Äôt start sport, then in the courtyard and at school, I would no longer have the position I was used to.'.."*
    - *"..'If I hadn‚Äôt got involved in sports, I‚Äôm not sure how my life would have turned out. It was sports that got me off the streets.'...But Volodya himself was maturing. His efforts at self-control, which Borisenko had remarked upon a year earlier, had progressed. **When he wrestled, the moment a bout was over, it would be as though the fight had never happened. The change was so sudden that it drew the coach‚Äôs attention ‚Äì an ability to switch instantly from aggression to friendliness was an unusual quality, he thought.** He noticed, too, that whether Volodya won or lost, nothing showed in his face. ‚ÄòHe was very reserved ‚Ä¶ At such moments, it was impossible to tell what he was feeling.‚Äô Not to show emotions was one of the key principles of both sambo and judo...intuitively he had somehow grasped the essence of the philosophy behind it."*
    - *"Part of the change was due to the realisation that important choices were looming. In working-class districts of Soviet cities in those days, when a boy reached fourteen, a boundary was crossed. Either he stayed with the other teenagers in the courtyard, where the older boys fought with bicycle chains, gambled and drank, and vied to become gang leaders, in which case he was on track for a criminal record, which the others would consider a badge of honour. Or he turned his back on that world and applied himself at school in the hope of gaining admission to a technical institute or, if he was really gifted, university. Khrushchev‚Äôs reforms had on the whole been extremely positive for children of Putin‚Äôs generation, bringing new possibilities unimaginable to their parents, but increased access to higher education was not one of them...It was impossible to enter university without being a member of the Komsomol, the Communist Party Youth League. But to join the Komsomol, it was necessary first to have been a Pioneer."*
    - *"...Pavel Morozov...The story was controversial. On the one hand, Russian tradition and Party policy stressed the importance of the patriarchal family structure. On the other, it was a perfect example of a child who put his revolutionary duty first. Even Stalin had mixed feelings. ‚ÄòWhat a little swine, denouncing his own father,‚Äô he was said to have commented privately."*
    - *"School, Pioneers and family were expected to work together to inculcate socialist values. Each class formed a Pioneer detachment, which was divided into ‚Äòlinks‚Äô, each composed of five or six children, which competed among themselves. If a child failed to pull his weight, the whole link was criticised and the slacker denounced in the class‚Äôs wall newspaper. Conversely, if he or she did particularly well, the link, not the individual, was praised. The lesson was that the judgement of the group was primordial, the individual was subordinate, and speaking out against the failings of one‚Äôs comrades was not only morally correct but in a child‚Äôs own interests, because otherwise he or she would be held jointly responsible for the others‚Äô mistakes...The family, in turn, was expected to inform the school how the child behaved at home, whether he or she was obedient and helped with the household chores...In practice, as with most things in the Soviet Union, theory and reality diverged."*
    - *"Having spent years as the class troublemaker, Putin found himself, in seventh grade, head of its Pioneer Council...Like the Scouts, the Pioneers exalted patriotism. The Pioneer Code, which they all had to learn by heart, declared: ‚Äòa Pioneer honours the memory of those who gave their lives in the struggle for freedom and for the flowering of the Soviet motherland.‚Äô**To Volodya and his classmates, as to children throughout the Soviet Union, that was no abstract formula. All of them had lost relatives in the war.** The school arranged visits to battlefields and to memorial sites, including Leningrad‚Äôs Piskaryovskoe cemetery, where his brother, Viktor, was buried. **Patriotism was coloured by Russian nationalism. Teachers emphasised the genius of Russian cultural figures ‚Äì Chekhov, Dostoyevsky and Pushkin, and the composers, Mussorgsky and Tchaikovsky ‚Äì and the role of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great in consolidating Muscovite power and the expansion of Russian territory.**."*
    - *"..**unusually independent-minded: 'He might agree or disagree with others, but it didn‚Äôt change what he thought.' Viktor Borisenko had the same impression. ‚ÄòMaking him do something by force was simply impossible. The only person who could really influence him was himself.'..Even his closest friend, Borisenko, said later that **there was an unspoken boundary in their relationship which he knew he should never cross. ‚ÄòWith him it was like this,‚Äô Borisenko said, ‚ÄòHe seemed to be with the rest of us, but he stood a little bit aside. He would take part in an event, but even though he was taking part in it, he was looking at it from outside. He had his own point of view in everything.'**."*
    - *"On camping trips, they sang together **the bitter-sweet songs of Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava, two very different, immensely talented poets whose lyrics were at the limit of what the Soviet system could accept, but who both ‚Äì especially Vysotsky, whose music even Brezhnev liked ‚Äì had protection in high places.**."*
    - *‚ÄúIn short, Putin lived what for his generation in Leningrad was the life of a normal teenager."*
    - *"...The same singleness of purpose would soon lead him to make a much more important and more difficult decision than enrolling in a key school. But before that could happen, he had to get clear in his own mind what he wished to do with his life...**In the 1950s and early ‚Äô60s, most Russians genuinely believed in the superiority of communism. It was true that the reality of their lives did not live up to the Party‚Äôs promises. But both older people and the younger generation felt that Soviet society had a moral compass, in contrast to the capitalist West where the law of the jungle prevailed, and that, whatever the difficulties, the country was headed in the right direction. After Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, that ceased to be the case.** Party leaders closed their eyes to corrupt deals by lower-level officials in return for a share of the proceeds. Schoolteachers accepted favours to give children better marks; doctors to give patients better treatment; policemen to overlook offences. It did not happen all at once and it did not affect everyone. Some, including Putin‚Äôs father, remained true believers all their lives. But gradually, over time, there was a creeping erosion of faith. To counter that, Brezhnev and his Politburo colleagues placed ever greater emphasis on ideological orthodoxy."*
    - *"...inakomyslyashchie, ‚Äòthose who think differently‚Äô....But that was exactly why Brezhnev had been appointed. He was a safe pair of hands who could be relied on to restore stability and make life predictable again. The innovation and excitement of the Khrushchev era were over...The new emphasis on ideological correctness made itself felt in the Komsomol. Already as Pioneers, children had been exhorted to ‚Äòunderstand the superiority of the Soviet system over the 'bourgeois system‚Äô. Now they were expected to ‚Äòraise their theoretical and ideological level‚Äô by studying Marx and Lenin in order ‚Äòto produce a new type of person‚Äô."*
    - *"...Yuri Andropov...Oleg Kalugin, wrote that ‚Äòhe genuinely believed that the United States and the West were working day and night to destroy the Soviet Union.‚Äô A year later, during what became known as the Prague Spring, when Czechoslovak communists attempted to loosen Soviet control and introduce a more democratic system, Andropov was convinced that it was due to Western meddling and must be put down by force...Andropov attempted to restore lustre to the KGB‚Äôs image, which had been catastrophically tarnished in the 1950s by Khrushchev‚Äôs revelations of its crimes under Stalin."*
    - *"Television series like The Shield and the Sword and **Seventeen Moments of Spring**, which related the exploits of Soviet agents in Nazi Germany during the Second World War, depicted intelligence officers as selfless patriots and heroes, defending the homeland at the risk of their lives."*
    - *"**The KGB, as Andropov conceived it, had a dual role: to defend Russians against ‚Äòcorrupting influences‚Äô from abroad, by persuasion if possible ‚Äì ‚Äòprophylactic work‚Äô, as it was called ‚Äì and by repression if not; and to use all possible means to weaken the ability of the Western powers to undermine the Soviet system.**"*
    - *"....'What amazed me most of all was how one man‚Äôs effort could achieve what whole armies could not. One spy could decide the fate of thousands of people'....If Putin concentrated on sport, he said, he might well become a national champion...**'If you want to win a fight, you have to carry it through to the end, as if it were the most decisive battle of your life.'**."*
    - Chapter 2 - Legal Niceties - *"Being at university was an eye-opener in other ways. Law students learnt about crime statistics and such things as sex offences which were never reported by the Soviet media. ‚ÄòWe understood that not everything was as good as we were constantly told on television and in the newspapers,‚Äô one student remembered....**Putin never openly called into question the prevailing orthodoxy. Unlike many of his fellow students, he did not listen to foreign radio stations. Events like the crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968 seem to have passed him by. That was in part because he had been brought up in a conventional Soviet proletarian family where politics was rarely discussed. But it also reflected the way that most Russians accepted as a matter of course the disconnect between Soviet ideals and the realities of everyday life.**."*
    - *"..in the first year, he went to the Komi Republic, on the Arctic Circle in the northern Urals, where Vorkuta, one of the harshest forced labour camps in the Stalinist prison system, had been located. There, six weeks chopping lumber and helping to repair houses earned him almost a thousand roubles, more money than he had ever seen in his life. When he returned home, after giving presents to his family, he bought an overcoat. He wrote later that it was the first possession he had ever felt was truly his own..."*
    - *"..Cheryomushkin (Putin's friend)..Putin was devastated. Borisenko remembered him at the funeral ceremony, standing by the coffin, ‚Äòcold ‚Ä¶ and distant ‚Ä¶ Like a statue, not a single muscle moved on his face ‚Ä¶ He seemed alienated, completely closed.‚Äô He found Putin‚Äôs lack of emotion shocking. Much later he learnt that afterwards, at the cemetery, when everyone else had left, and Putin and Cheryomushkin‚Äôs mother and sister, and another close friend, Kolya Alekhov, watched the coffin being lowered into the grave, **he had collapsed, weeping uncontrollably. ‚ÄòHe cried for so long,‚Äô Alekhov remembered, ‚Äònone of us could calm him down.‚Äô The icy demeanour which had repelled Borisenko was a front, a protective shell, to stop himself breaking down in public.**...‚ÄòThere were moments,‚Äô Borisenko said, ‚Äòwhen Volodya became as if made of iron. I am talking about his inner attitude ‚Ä¶ He holds to the norms of behaviour ‚Ä¶ that have been instilled in him since childhood...Putin did not give up sport after Cheryomushkin‚Äôs death. He would have considered it weak, even disloyal, to have done so. He travelled all over the Soviet Union for competitions and, later that year, became a full Master of Sport at sambo, which meant he was ranked as a national champion. Two years later, he qualified as a Master of Sport in judo as well."*
    - *"Putin was attracted to law not merely as a vehicle towards a career in the KGB. It interested him for its own sake. As a schoolchild, he once said, **he had never wanted others to recognise him as their chief. He preferred the role of arbitrator, ‚Äòan unspoken leader, playing the role of the judicial branch, not the executive‚Äô** That memory was no doubt coloured by subsequent experiences: in the Soviet Union, arbitration did not have to be impartial...**All Soviet citizens, even children, knew that anyone whose actions were seen as inimical to the Soviet social, economic and, above all, political order risked exemplary punishment.**.."*
    - *"A ‚Äòparasitic way of life‚Äô was illegal because earning money from activities other than those authorised by the state undermined the social system. ‚ÄòSpeculation‚Äô, meaning buying and selling goods for a profit, was illegal because it undermined the economic system. Even such purely criminal offences as murder, rape and theft, had a political aspect, not only because they were socially disruptive but because they called into question the omnipotence of the state. For the same reason, fewer than one per cent of criminal trials ended in acquittal, because acquittals implied that the state, in the shape of the prosecutors, was mistaken. **The primary purpose of Soviet law, one writer concluded, was not to protect the citizenry but to ‚Äòdefend institutional authority by giving it an aura of legitimacy‚Äô**."*
    - *"**There was no attempt to instil critical thinking or the ability to produce a reasoned argument, no Socratic questions and answers to draw out the students‚Äô ideas. Instead, they were expected to learn by rote, in order to produce ‚Äòthe correct answer, the answer that the teacher wants‚Äô.**."*
    - *"...Professor Olimpiad Ioffe, the university‚Äôs ‚Äì and the Soviet Union‚Äôs ‚Äì foremost authority on civil law. He had an entertaining, avuncular style, and lectured without notes. ‚ÄòStudents from the senior classes used to come back just to hear him speak,‚Äô one remembered. ‚ÄòEverything was from memory, and his memory was brilliant.‚Äô Putin liked him"*
    - *"'An operative must be inconspicuous, outwardly appearing as an ordinary person,‚Äô a KGB general wrote. ‚ÄòI completely rejected those who were attracted to intelligence by romance or love of adventure. The best of those whom I selected looked the exact opposite of the image of an operative created in fiction.‚Äô The last thing the service needed was someone who resembled James Bond. On almost every count ‚Äì except, perhaps, his romanticising of the profession, which he tried hard not to let show ‚Äì Putin was an ideal candidate...'If you were too enthusiastic, it wasn‚Äôt good, because it showed you had no character. But if you didn‚Äôt report anything, that meant that you were lazy. The KGB never sought out the best or the brightest students, nor did it want the dumb or lazy ones.

    - *"...Helsinki Final Act. The agreement was important to Brezhnev because it confirmed Europe‚Äôs post-war borders, effectively consolidating Moscow‚Äôs gains in the Second World War. But in return he had had to accept the so-called ‚Äòthird basket‚Äô of the accords, under which the Soviet Union pledged support for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Helsinki turned into a rallying cry for dissidents in the Soviet Union and throughout Eastern Europe..."*
    - *"**The new orthodoxy under Brezhnev was that Stalin had made some errors, but the system itself had been good.**."*
    - *"At the **Dzerzhinsky School**, Putin was encouraged to take a broader view of intelligence work than he had in Leningrad. In the Fifth Department, his job had been to expose ‚Äòanti-Soviet elements‚Äô among the population. Now he was trained to seek information about Soviet √©migr√© organisations and the activities of Western intelligence services. His main task would be to make contact with foreigners arriving in the Soviet Union who might be open to recruitment or ideological manipulation...Since the KGB worked on the principle that Western intelligence services were a mirror image of themselves, it followed that their adversaries would ‚Äòdo prophylactic work among their own citizens before they come to the Soviet Union ‚Ä¶ and, on their return, many of them will undergo questioning ‚Ä¶ to find out if they have been approached by Soviet intelligence.‚Äô"*

    - *"...**He did not simply play his cards close to his chest, mask his emotions, and send out ambiguous signals: he maintained an impenetrable shell, which prevented even those closest to him from divining his true intentions.** One may legitimately wonder what prompted him to take the plunge. Putin himself said that his friends had urged him to get married and he realised that if he did not do so soon, he would stay a bachelor for ever, implying that it was a marriage of reason, rather than of love. That may well have been the case, although perhaps for a different motive. That spring, he had learnt that he might be in line for further training which could open the way to a post abroad. Married officers were preferred for foreign postings because a family was viewed as a source of stability. As Lyudmila remarked later, **whenever an important decision was to be taken, Volodya did not act spontaneously. ‚ÄòEverything he did was always thought through.'**."*
    - *"...kokoshnik(–∫–æ–∫–æÃÅ—à–Ω–∏–∫), the traditional Russian maids‚Äô caps, a relic of tsarist times..."*
    - *"...**Emphasis was placed on applied psychology. The books in the library included a Russian translation of Dale Carnegie‚Äôs How to Make Friends and Influence People and, even more than at the Dzerzhinsky School four years earlier, the instructors stressed the importance of ‚Äòbuilding interpersonal relationships‚Äô, without which, they insisted, no intelligence work was possible. Another course focused on analysis: how to anticipate trends, how to prioritise information and how to write reports. There was an ironclad rule: ‚ÄòOne cable, one topic.‚Äô If a message was intercepted and deciphered, only one topic would be compromised. They were taught how to recognise ‚Äòdangles‚Äô, Western intelligence officers who turned up at Soviet embassies, posing as ‚Äòwalk-ins‚Äô with important information to share. They learnt the different roles of ‚Äòneutral contacts‚Äô (people of no intelligence value whom an officer befriended in order to confuse an adverse counter-intelligence service); ‚Äòinformation contacts‚Äô (official sources whom he might meet in the course of his work, but with whom he had no intelligence relationship); ‚Äòtrusted contacts‚Äô (persons whom the officer met publicly but with whom, secretly, he also had ‚Äúan intelligence relationship); and ‚Äòagents‚Äô (who spied on his behalf). They practised ‚Äòbrush contacts‚Äô (receiving a document from a source in a crowd without being seen), and the use of dead-letter drops, as well as of technical devices ‚Äì tape recorders, concealed microphones and miniature cameras.**."*
    - *"...It had taken Putin ten years in the service, almost to the day, to gain the position that he had dreamt of as a teenager, when his imagination had been caught by series like The Shield and the Sword and Seventeen Moments of Spring. It was not quite what he had hoped for all those years ago. Working in a provincial directorate had cured him of the romantic notions with which he had started out. **From an intelligence-gathering standpoint, East Germany was a province, not much different from Leningrad.**."*
    - *"...**'Putin had the manners and behaviour of a special services officer.'** The label would stick. Senator John McCain famously remarked: ‚ÄòI looked in Putin‚Äôs eyes and I saw three letters: a K, a G and a B.'."*
    - *"...Western newspaper articles invariably mention his KGB past, as though that in itself is enough to explain why he acts as he does. **But did the KGB form Putin? Or was he already, before he joined, in all important respects the person he would later become?** Putin himself is on record as saying that much of what he was taught in the KGB, he already knew long before. **If something happens, you should proceed from the fact that there is no retreat [he said]. It is necessary to carry it through to the end.** That‚Äôs a well-known rule that was taught by the KGB, but I learnt it much earlier, scrapping with other kids. There was another rule the KGB taught. **Don‚Äôt reach for a weapon unless you are prepared to use it** ‚Ä¶ It was the same on the street. [There] relations were clarified with fists. You didn‚Äôt get involved unless you were prepared to see it through...From judo he had learnt how to use others‚Äô strengths against them and to exploit their vulnerabilities. At the Dzerzhinsky School he was taught that ‚Äòall else being equal, the side which goes onto the attack will achieve the best results‚Äô, a principle the KGB called nastupatelnost, ‚Äòoffensive posture‚Äô. That, too, was familiar, both from judo and from his childhood fights."*
    - *"Putin‚Äôs character fitted the kind of work the KGB did. **He liked to stay in the background and observe others, rather than to be the centre of attention himself. He was disciplined and pragmatic and able to concentrate his energies on the priority of the moment. He had been brought up not to show his emotions, which was another quality the KGB valued.**."*
    - *"This is not to say that Putin gained nothing from his years with the KGB. But by the time he graduated from the Law Faculty, he was almost 23 years old and his personality was already formed. At the Dzerzhinsky School and the Red Banner Institute, he learnt new skills and techniques ‚Äì how to manipulate an asset, how to analyse and evaluate information, how to distinguish the principal aspect of a problem from what was secondary. He was taught how to appraise contacts. Were they likely to be useful? If not, why waste time on them? Above all, he learnt never to take things at face value, to mistrust others‚Äô motives and intentions. **Intelligence work is plagued by paranoia.** Is a source what he or she claims to be, or are they working for another service, deliberately laying a false trail? But here, too, there was already a firm foundation on which his instructors could build. **Even as a child, Volodya Putin had concealed his hand; as a young man, he did not vouchsafe information unless there was good reason.**."*
    - *"**Putin‚Äôs time with the special services influenced his thinking and equipped him with new tools with which to view the world. But it did so by accretion. Putin was already Putin before he joined the KGB.**."*
    - Chapter 4 - Quiet Days in Saxony - *"Like all Soviet visitors to East Germany, she was struck by the wealth of goods available in the shops, compared to what could be bought at home. So was Putin. ‚ÄòWe had come from a Russia,‚Äô he wrote later, ‚Äòwhere there were long lines and shortages, and in East Germany there was always plenty of everything.‚Äô Even bananas, which were unobtainable in the Soviet Union, could be bought in the army commissariat, to which, as a KGB officer, he had access. **It was the small details which Lyudmila noticed: the politeness of the shop assistants, who took time to find out what each customer wanted and to wrap each purchase individually, and then asked if they would like anything else, unlike their counterparts in Leningrad, who responded only to customers‚Äô shouts and then snarled that there was none left; the fact that there were no queues, that the streets were clean, that Germans cleaned the windows of their apartments every week; and the orderly way in which German housewives hung out their washing each morning on clothes lines in the courtyard.**."*
    - *"..Putin was left a bachelor and his eye began to wander...She found him attractive and he evidently felt the same way. That night, she remembered, he started drinking, which he rarely did in public, until, having got up his courage to kiss her, they engaged in some heavy petting. It was a brief lapse, which did not lead very far. Today she says that chapter of her life is closed: it was a youthful infatuation. But Putin had taken a serious risk. Neither the Stasi nor the KGB permitted extramarital relations. He had still not completely overcome his old problem of a ‚Äòlowered sense of danger‚Äô."*
    - *"At mealtimes, she remembered, ‚Äòhe was capricious ‚Ä¶ If he did not think a dish was done properly, he would rather not eat it at all.‚Äô When she had made a particular effort to please him, and would wait, as she said, ‚Äòwith a sinking heart‚Äô to hear his reaction, he would say, ‚Äòthe meat is rather dry.‚Äô If it was really good he might say grudgingly, ‚Äònot bad‚Äô. She consoled herself with the thought that he was just applying the old Russian adage: ‚ÄòPraise the woman, spoil the home.'."*
    - *"Formally both he and Putin belonged to Line N...Line N officers had two principal tasks: identifying potential recruits who might be trained as illegal agents, and assembling documents and other material which could be used to create ‚Äòlegends‚Äô as cover stories for them. Western intelligence services almost never use illegals: the investment required to train and disguise an illegal agent is out of all proportion to the likely return. But in Russia, old traditions die hard. The Cheka started using illegals out of necessity, rather than choice, at a time when the Soviet Union had no diplomatic relations with the United States and tenuous ties with other Western countries, which made it impossible to set up legal residencies under diplomatic cover.Putin later claimed that ‚Äòall my work in foreign intelligence was connected ‚Ä¶ specifically with illegal intelligence‚Äô. That was stretching the truth. He may have spent some of his time with the First Department in Leningrad on Line N matters, but it was certainly not his main task there."*
    - *"Agartanov called him ‚Äòan ordinary representative of our profession, ‚Ä¶ polite, affable, alert and unobtrusive, [but] not in any way outstanding‚Äô. Viktor Adianov said he was ‚Äòhardly a superspy ‚Ä¶ not someone who stood out from his colleagues‚Äô. Bragin said Putin was ‚Äòon a par with everyone else, without any special achievements‚Äô. Both he and Adianov described him as a ‚Äòworkaholic‚Äô and by comparison with them, he probably was, but to Agartanov he was ‚Äòconscientious and no more than that‚Äô and Matveyev concurred. On two points, however, Agartanov and Bragin agreed. **Putin had a way of ingratiating himself with older people. As Agartanov put it: ‚ÄòHe was able to win over anyone he liked, but especially people his father‚Äôs age.‚Äô** They also thought that he was not ambitious. In Bragin‚Äôs words, ‚Äòhe did not dream of a career.'...if Putin did aspire to higher things during his time in Dresden, he took good care to hide it."*
    - *"Perestroika, or ‚Äòrestructuring‚Äô, and glasnost, ‚Äòopenness‚Äô, the two signature programmes of the Soviet Union‚Äôs new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were then still in their infancy. Most people thought that they would be just another failed attempt at reform which in the end would lead nowhere. Gorbachev had taken power in March 1985, succeeding Brezhnev‚Äôs long-time aide, Konstantin Chernenko, and the former KGB chief, Andropov, both of whom had been in chronic ill health and lasted less than 15 months in office. **A year later his most visible achievement had been to launch a bitterly contested campaign against alcoholism.**..‚ÄúBut where Matveyev supported the campaign in principle, Putin did not. **Alcoholism, he agreed, was a scourge, but the only effective means of fighting it was to raise the general cultural level of society. His reasons were strictly practical. Prohibition drove the problem underground, boosting illegal production of home-distilled liquor and poisonous surrogates and provoking a senseless mass movement to uproot valuable vineyards.**....had seen former colleagues from the Fifth Department posted outside cinemas and bathhouses to enforce a campaign which Andropov had launched to stop officials skiving off during working hours. **That, too, he said, had been a mistake. It was an abuse of administrative measures and it did not solve the problem it was intended to address.**....**Eventually the anti-alcohol campaign was curtailed, though not for the reasons Putin had adduced. It was wound up because the state could not do without the revenue from vodka sales.**."*
    - *"**Arguing was pointless, he told Agartanov: it changed nothing and only put oneself and one‚Äôs family at risk. ‚ÄòA person only has one life. Why waste it banging your head against a brick wall?'**...**The disconnect between what one could say and what one could think, which Soviet citizens had factored into their behaviour since childhood without reflecting overmuch on the implications, became harder to ignore in the altered climate of the 1980s.** In the KGB, that was especially true...young officers in the 1980s who ‚Äòknew much more about the flaws in the system than their compatriots, became critical of events and began to realise the need for change and renewal. **They saw perfectly clearly that the system‚Äôs own absurdities were causing as much damage to the country as all the foreign intelligence agencies put together.**'.Putin had been struck by a conversation with a KGB colleague who had been with the Soviet army in Afghanistan. The man had told him that his main achievement there had been preventing pointless Soviet bombing raids. **Putin had already realised that the war had been a mistake. Even so, he said, he was stunned. ‚ÄòAfter discussions like that, you start to think and rethink things.‚Äô By the late 1980s, Putin was rethinking a great deal. Vladimir Bragin concluded that Putin was no longer a communist.**."*
    - *"...**Putin, in private considered communism an impossible dream..Putin had been deeply impressed by the private shops and small enterprises which the East German communists allowed to operate alongside the state sector. They were a different world from the grim, unwelcoming state stores at home with their empty shelves, bored shop hands and surly cashiers.75 Private ownership, Putin concluded, was key. If people were to be motivated, they had to be allowed to accumulate property and to pass it on to their children. If the economy was to develop, there had to be competition.**."*
    - *"**In the first years of perestroika, Putin, like many others, had grave doubts about Gorbachev‚Äôs reforms. The problems, he argued, were systemic. Tinkering would achieve nothing.**."*
    - *"..The exchange of favours, known as blat, had always been part of the Soviet system. But there was a difference between voluntarily giving preference to a friend; feeling obliged to give preference to a friend; and giving preference in return for a bribe. Putin held that the first was difficult to avoid. The second and third were inadmissible."*
    - *"..Putin admired the Germans. They were orderly and diligent. They knew how to work and how to have fun without getting blind drunk as Russians did.84 There was of course a more troubling side, too. Visiting Buchenwald and the sites of other Nazi concentration camps, Agartanov wrote, **‚Äòit was hard to believe that the satraps running these camps were the same Germans, brought up in the same way, with the same good manners, attending concerts of classical music ‚Ä¶ as those who accompanied us.‚Äô** But the ‚Äòreal eye-opener‚Äô, as Putin put it, was the backwardness of the East German political system. He had expected to be living in a European state. Instead he found himself in ‚Äòa harshly totalitarian country, similar to what the Soviet Union had been 30 years earlier ‚Ä¶ The entire population was under surveillance as though they were still living in Stalin‚Äôs time.‚Äô Perestroika and glasnost were anathema."*
    - *"...‚Äòhostile centres will immediately exploit glasnost and perestroika and use it as a cover for their operations ‚Ä¶ The fundamental issue is capitalism or socialism. If [Moscow] goes towards capitalism, we can forget about socialism.'..."*
    - *"Gorbachev‚Äôs failure to stem the growth of nationalism was not the only sign that the Soviet system was beginning to flounder. The nuclear power plant explosion at Chernobyl in April 1986, had been a major blow to Soviet pride. So was the exploit of Matthias Rust, a young West German who, on May 28, 1987, a few days short of his nineteenth birthday, flew a light aircraft from Helsinki to Moscow, making a mockery of Soviet air defences, and landed near Red Square. **For the reformers in the Soviet leadership, both events had a silver lining. The first provided a rationale for ending excessive secrecy and promoting glasnost. The second gave Gorbachev a pretext for purging the hardliners in the military opposed to perestroika.**."*
    - *"....At that point, Putin understood that the East German leaders were losing control. But even then, he said later, ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt imagine that the regime would collapse so quickly.‚Äô...Nor did Mikhail Gorbachev....**The Berlin Wall had fallen. In the dramatic weeks between the beginning of October, when demonstrators stormed the Dresden railway station, and the breaching of the Wall on November 9, Putin watched impotently as history unfolded before his eyes. He said later that he understood intellectually that the situation in East Germany was unnatural and that ‚Äòa position built on walls and divisions cannot last.‚Äô103 But that was with hindsight. When it happened, he could only stand and stare. Beyond East Germany‚Äôs borders, the Kremlin‚Äôs grip was weakening. In Ukraine, Rukh, a reformist-nationalist movement, was gaining strength with discreet support from Leonid Kravchuk, the wily Second Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party. In Kishinyov, the capital of Moldavia, anti-communist protesters burned down the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In Prague, after huge demonstrations and a general strike, the entire Communist Party leadership resigned and multi-party elections were called, as they had been earlier in Poland and Hungary, ending the Party‚Äôs monopoly of power. Shortly afterwards, Bulgaria followed suit. By the time the year ended, Romania‚Äôs communist regime, the last in the former Soviet bloc, had fallen and its leader, Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, and his wife had been executed.**."*
    - *"It is possible that that night in Dresden did play a formative role. **Memories crystallise over time. ‚ÄòThat business of ‚ÄúMoscow is silent‚Äù,‚Äô Putin said later. ‚ÄòI got the feeling then that the country no longer existed ‚Ä¶ The [Soviet] Union was ailing. It had a terminal disease without a cure ‚Äì a paralysis of power.‚Äô But that was said more than a decade after, when he had different responsibilities and a very different agenda. In reality, it had been much less of a crisis than his memories made out. Far from having to wait several hours for military support, a patrol had been despatched to secure the building within thirty minutes.112 His boss at Karlshorst, Sergei Bezrukov, to whom he reported next day, remembered it as a minor episode of no particular importance. But for Putin, it was the culmination of weeks of frustration, as East Germany ‚Äì a country which he had come to regard as a second home ‚Äì fell apart, while the mighty Soviet Union did nothing to stop it.**."*
    - *"...**He could understand that East Germans regarded their security service as a monstrous organisation, but it was the system which was wrong, not those who worked within it. ‚ÄòThe people I knew were decent people,‚Äô Putin insisted. ‚ÄòThey were my friends and I will not renounce them.‚Äô** Some Stasi officers, he admitted, had ‚Äòprobably‚Äô maltreated people, but he ‚Äòpersonally did not see it‚Äô. It was the same reasoning that led him to minimise the horrors committed by the NKVD under Stalin. The state was a reflection of the society from which it came. So were its faults. In the middle of December, the KGB group in Dresden was ordered to start burning its archives. ‚ÄòWe destroyed everything ‚Äì all our communications, our lists of contacts and agent networks,‚Äô Putin remembered. The office possessed an incinerator for that purpose, but the sheer volume of papers to be consumed was so great that it overheated and exploded."*
    - *"...The truth was simpler. As Bezrukov suspected, Putin had been withdrawn to be given a new assignment ‚Äì an assignment which would lay the groundwork for everything that followed. In May 1989, the Congress of People‚Äôs Deputies had held its opening session in Moscow. The debates, which were broadcast live, transfixed the Soviet public. For two weeks, the whole country was at a standstill. Factories stopped work, the ministries were idle. People spent their days glued to television sets and transistor radios, and the evenings discussing what they had heard....**Not a single sacred cow has escaped assault. The leadership have been cross-examined about their private lives. The Party has been accused of narrowmindedness, privilege, and corruption. The government has been accused of gross mismanagement. The army has been accused of mounting punitive expeditions against the civil population, and its invasion of Afghanistan called a shameful crime. The KGB has been publicly assailed for murder and torture. Even Lenin has not escaped entirely: the proposal to remove him from his mausoleum, which so infuriated the Party in April, was publicly repeated ‚Ä¶ What has been said ‚Äì about the mismanagement of the economy, the weaknesses of the leadership, the bankruptcy of the Party, the brutality of the army and police ‚Äì cannot be unsaid.** ...**In the past, criticisms like this had been heard only from the most outspoken dissidents. Now they were coming from reformers within the Communist Party itself.**."*
    - *"...'When Sobchak stood up to speak ‚Äì and I used to attend those sessions ‚Äì people listened. He was scathing, critical, eloquent, brilliant ‚Ä¶ He was an orator and he was very clever ‚Ä¶ he was an impressive guy.‚Äô...At a time when most Soviet politicians still ‚Äúdressed drably, he came to debates wearing an elegantly cut beige-and-white plaid jacket which made him look, as Yeltsin‚Äôs political strategist, Gleb Pavlovsky, put it, ‚Äòas though he‚Äôd just walked off the Champs Elys√©es after shopping in a designer boutique‚Äô. It became such a trademark that in Soviet department stores, plaid jackets were referred to as ‚Äòsobchaks‚Äô. Alfred Kokh, a young economist who would go on to become one of Yeltsin‚Äôs deputy Prime Ministers, thought ‚Äòhe looked just the way a real politician should ‚Ä¶ Handsome, impressive. Bold. Smart. Educated. An aristocratic spirit ‚Ä¶ We adored him. There was nobody like him ‚Ä¶ He was one of a kind.‚Äù*
    - *"...Anatoly Chubais, the future head of Yeltsin‚Äôs privatisation programme..."*
    - *"...Left to his own devices, Putin‚Äôs preferences would have been for Leningrad. **Russians are territorial: Putin was a Leningrader through and through.** His parents were nearly 80 years old and his mother was in poor health. Like other KGB officers at that time, he may also have had doubts about the future of the organisation. He had just seen his counterparts in the Stasi lose careers, which they had expected to last a lifetime, almost overnight. **The Soviet Union had abandoned its positions throughout Eastern Europe. No one could say for sure what lay ahead in Russia either. If his career in the security services were to come to an abrupt end, it would be better to deal with that in Leningrad than in an unfamiliar city like Moscow.**."*
    - Chapter 5 - Back in the USSR - *"**After four years of perestroika, the crime rate in the Soviet Union was soaring and the economy was in free fall.** Although they had returned to Leningrad on holiday each summer, the penury in the shops, after the plenty of Dresden, still came as a shock. To buy sugar, you needed a ration card and, starting on February 1, 1990, two days before they arrived, other basic foodstuffs could be purchased only with an identity card, proving residence in the city. **‚ÄòThere were terrible lines [and] empty shelves,‚Äô Lyudmila remembered. ‚ÄòFor a while after we ‚Äúreturned home, I was even afraid to go to the store ‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt able, like some people, to sniff out all the bargains ‚Ä¶ I would just ‚Ä¶ buy whatever was most necessary and go home. It was horrible.‚Äô** To make matters worse, because of the initial uncertainty over where Putin was to work, there was a dispute over which department should pay his salary. That took three months to resolve and they almost ran out of money. **But the most striking change was in people‚Äôs attitudes. Not only had living conditions, already bad in the mid 1980s, deteriorated further in the four and a half years the family had been away, but ordinary citizens now said openly, with all the grim melodrama which Russians affect at such times, exactly what they thought of their lives, their government and a future in which they saw nothing good. The words on everyone‚Äôs lips were razval and grazhdanskaya voina, ‚Äòcollapse‚Äô and ‚Äòcivil war'.**"*
    - *"'All the antagonisms which had earlier been contained [are] bursting out into the open: the desire for independence on the part of the border republics; the grumbling of those at the base of the political-economic pyramid against those in the upper echelons; the inevitable search for scapegoats ‚Äì in which old-line Stalinists in the Party apparat join forces with right-wing nationalists against the Jews and the Judeo-masonic conspiracy ‚Ä¶ **Add to that a generalised mistrust of the currency, fuelled by fears of economic and monetary reform; endemic food shortages in parts of the Russian Federation; increasingly open activity by all kinds of mafia organisations; accelerating disruption of the tissue of economic production and of all public services (transport, communications, health, justice); a vertiginous rise in criminality; the collapse of the family unit ‚Ä¶ and you have some idea of the moral disarray in which the population of the Soviet Union finds itself.'**."*
    - *"**'Russia has become the slum of the industrialised world,‚Äô another Western diplomat wrote. ‚ÄòIts environment is devastated and its health system in crisis.‚Äô Drunkenness was such a problem that in some parts of the Soviet Union, one child in six was born mentally retarded from an alcoholic mother. In Leningrad, with its endless winters, half the streetlights did not work and the roads were full of potholes. The most popular Soviet film that year ‚Äì a comparison between life in Russia and life in the West ‚Äì was entitled Tak zhit nelzya, ‚ÄòWe Can‚Äôt Live like This‚Äô.**."*
    - *"..That spring, Putin‚Äôs boss, the Vice Rector, Yuri Molchanov, reached agreement with the US beauty products company, Procter and Gamble, to set up a joint venture. In return for a small share of equity, the university provided office accommodation and an entr√©e to the city‚Äôs political and economic elite. **Putin was not directly involved, but it opened his eyes to the possibilities that economic cooperation with Western companies might bring.**."*
    - *"**If it was difficult to adjust to the social and economic upheaval, it was even harder to come to terms with the political transformation that Russia was undergoing. It had been one thing to sit in Dresden, reading liberal magazines like Ogonyok and Novy mir and watching Soviet television. It was quite another to be plunged into the midst of a city, and a country, in ebullition, where the rules today bore little relation to what they had been yesterday or what they might become tomorrow.**."*
    - *"...In February, less than a week after his return, the Central Committee, meeting in Moscow, voted to end the Party‚Äôs ‚Äòleading role‚Äô and install presidential rule ‚Äì **momentous decisions which fundamentally changed the Soviet system and opened the way, in theory at least, to multi-party democracy.** A month later, after the changes had been ratified by the Congress of People‚Äôs Deputies, Anatoly Sobchak, whom Putin was following, as he put it, ‚Äòwith great interest‚Äô, was nominated by the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies as its candidate to succeed Gorbachev as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the Congress‚Äôs Executive Committee, when the latter became Head of State...Sobchak was a free spirit, who tended to go his own way...Gorbachev‚Äôs candidate, Anatoly Lukyanov ‚Äì a choice which Gorbachev would later bitterly regret...Lensoviet.."*
    - *"...but he also understood that he needed competent people who could guide him through the maze of Soviet bureaucracy. As Putin would put it later, **‚Äòhe needed [people] who knew which buttons to push to get things done‚Äô**...He had earlier asked Oleg Kalugin, the former deputy head of the Leningrad Directorate, to recommend to him a retired KGB officer who might be suitable. Kalugin had suggested two names, but Sobchak thought they were both too high-powered.41 He wanted someone who would carry out his instructions without question and answer only to him. **Putin fitted the bill perfectly. Mindful of his liberal credentials, Sobchak had no wish to let it be known that he had deliberately recruited a KGB officer as one of his principal advisers. Putin was equally keen to avoid any suggestion that he had joined Sobchak‚Äôs team on the KGB‚Äôs instructions.**."*
    - *"...Aleksandr Nevzorov presented a television show called ‚Äò600 Seconds‚Äô, which specialised in expos√©s of official misdeeds and was wildly popular all over Russia..."*
    - *"**When he had returned from Dresden in February, the Soviet Union was still a one-party state. In April, that already seemed another age. That month, he had watched tens of thousands of people gathering for protest rallies in front of the Winter Palace, the first to have been permitted since 1917. Newspapers began to discuss previously forbidden topics: the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family at Yekaterinburg in 1918; the murder of the Leningrad leader, Sergei Kirov, on Stalin‚Äôs orders in 1934, preceding the Great Purge; the assassination of Trotsky in 1940; and the massacre of 22,000 Polish officers at Katyn by the NKVD the same year.** In June, within days of Putin agreeing to work for Sobchak, the authority of his new patron was being challenged, an experience which he found ‚Äòvery unpleasant‚Äô. Two months later, the same deputies who had begged Sobchak to become their Chairman were attempting to have him dismissed. **To anyone who had grown up with the soporific predictability of Brezhnev-era Soviet politics, it was bewildering and a little frightening.**."*
    - *"...He spent the spring and early summer keeping his head down and observing what was happening around him. There was no way of telling what the next few months might bring or even whether Sobchak would be able to remain in power. As he put it later, ‚ÄòIt was risky to tie my future to his. Everything might unravel at a moment‚Äôs notice.‚Äô At one point, he started exploring other options. Galina Starovoitova, an anthropologist and leading member of the Inter-Regional Group, who was almost as prominent as Sobchak in the Leningrad democratic movement, decided to stand for the newly created Russian Congress of People‚Äôs Deputies, representing the Sestroretsk‚ÄìZelenogorsk constituency. Putin introduced himself and offered to act as her chauffeur during her campaign. According to her parliamentary assistant, Ruslan Linkov, for ten days in late May or early June, at about the same time that he was introduced to Sobchak, he drove her to campaign meetings...Putin did not finally commit to working for Sobchak until October, when it became clear that the Lensoviet Chairman had weathered the storm. **Dmitry Medvedev**, another of Sobchak‚Äôs former students, who was serving as a part-time adviser dealing with legal affairs and relations with the Lensoviet deputies, remembered Sobchak introducing them."*
    - *"To outward appearances, Putin was a minion who carried Sobchak‚Äôs briefcase and remained discreetly in his shadow, never putting himself forward. But, behind the scenes, Pavlov said, ‚Äòhe took over personnel matters, issues relating to production, the reception and despatch of documents. It became like a puppet theatre.‚Äô Over time, that would indeed happen, but it did not occur all at once. At the end of 1990 and in the first half of 1991, Putin was still feeling his way. Nevertheless, before the year was up, Pavlov already found Putin‚Äôs methods sufficiently different from his own that he decided that he could not work with him any longer. **‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt want ‚Äì in fact I refused ‚Äì to work in the system which Putin had set up. In terms of humanitarian ideas, ideas of justice, how to build up society and the state, my way was closer to Sobchak‚Äôs ideas. But my system was weaker, it didn‚Äôt have any people with epaulettes, there weren‚Äôt any armed men ‚Ä¶ I was someone who could empathise, who could be close to people. Putin was the opposite. We had different paths.'**."*
    -  *"...**The only person he seems to have trusted completely was Dmitry Medvedev**..."*
    -  *"..The city on the Neva ‚Äì Northern Palmyra, as its inhabitants called it, after the great cultural centre of the ancient world in Syria ‚Äì still saw itself as Russia‚Äôs northern capital, as it had been before 1917."*
    -  *"**For months, the Soviet Union had been threatening to break apart. But it was one thing to read about agitation far away in the Caucasus, quite another for Putin to find that it was happening on his own doorstep. In the event, the tipping point came not in Estonia but in Lithuania, the southernmost Baltic republic, which Gorbachev had been pressuring to rescind what he called ‚Äòunconstitutional acts‚Äô, meaning moves towards independence. After the Lithuanians refused to back down, in the early hours of Sunday, January 13, 1991, Soviet special forces stormed the television tower in the capital, Vilnius, scattering crowds of demonstrators who had gathered to defend it, killing 14 and wounding 160. The bloodshed provoked a crisis. Yeltsin flew to Tallinn, where, in the parliament building, ringed with barricades and defended by volunteers armed with shotguns and hunting rifles, he issued a joint statement with the Presidents of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, ‚Äòresolutely condemning acts of armed violence against the independence of ‚Äúthe Baltic States‚Äô. Leningrad, but not Moscow, television broadcast film of the attack, showing black-uniformed officers from the Soviet Interior Ministry bludgeoning demonstrators with rifle butts. Gorbachev waffled, claiming that what had happened was not his doing and that the military had staged a provocation to discredit him. No one in the Baltic republics, or in Leningrad, believed him. The Lensoviet met in emergency session to pass resolutions condemning his actions and, the following Sunday, thousands gathered for a protest demonstration on the square in front of the Winter Palace.**."*
    -  *"**Gorbachev‚Äôs popularity had been waning ever since perestroika began. The more he was lionised abroad, the more he was detested at home. The previous twelve months had been his annus horribilis, the year when everything started to go wrong. On May Day, 1990, he had been booed by demonstrators in Red Square. In July, Yeltsin had resigned spectacularly from the Communist Party. Sobchak and the Chairman of the Moscow City Council, Gavriil Popov, had followed suit. During the autumn, Gorbachev embraced and then abandoned an ambitious programme of market reform, the so-called ‚Äò500 Days‚Äô project. Finally, in December, his close ally, the Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, announced that he, too, was resigning, warning melodramatically: ‚ÄòA dictatorship is coming ‚Ä¶ No one knows what kind of dictatorship or who will be the dictator. [But] let this be my protest.‚Äô Until the Vilnius incident, Gorbachev had managed to hold off what was termed the ‚ÄòPrague scenario‚Äô, whereby agitation for freedom would be crushed by Soviet tanks. That was what had happened in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and it was what the hardliners in the Politburo and the military wanted.**"*
    -  *"**After January 1991, Putin concluded that Gorbachev was ‚Äòpolitically exhausted‚Äô. Two months later, Yeltsin engineered a constitutional change enabling him to be elected Russia‚Äôs President by popular vote, giving him a legitimacy which Gorbachev did not have. Shortly afterwards the Soviet leader made another fateful concession: the USSR would be replaced by a new, voluntary ‚ÄòUnion of Sovereign States‚Äô, comprising Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and the five Central Asian republics. The Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova refused to take part, but Gorbachev had recognised by then that they were going to become independent anyway and there was nothing he could do to stop them. Although ‚Äúno one would yet say so publicly, the Soviet Union‚Äôs future was already hanging by a thread.**."*
    -  *"**Leningrad voters had to decide a second, much more contentious issue: whether the city should return to its pre-revolutionary name, St Petersburg. Sobchak had initially opposed the idea, as had Gorbachev, on the grounds that Leningrad was associated so closely with the heroism and tragedy of the war. Many veterans and their families, Putin among them, felt that changing the city‚Äôs name would dishonour the 750,000 men, women and children who had died, as well as the survivors. There were demonstrations and counter-demonstrations. The exiled writer, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, proposed, not very helpfully, Holy Petrograd as an alternative. In the end, nearly 55 per cent voted for St Petersburg, and 42 per cent against. By then Sobchak had changed ‚Äúhis mind and, when the result was announced, sought the credit for the decision.**."*
    -  *"...**On the other hand, the path now seemed clear to a new Union Treaty, which would preserve the essence of the Soviet Union, albeit in diminished form.**."*
    -  *"..The telephone lines to Gorbachev‚Äôs villa in Foros had been cut and he had been reduced to listening to the BBC World Service on an old-fashioned, short-wave radio to get news of what was happening....Sobchak thought afterwards that the coup plotters had assumed that the population would accept Gorbachev‚Äôs removal without question and that there would be no more than token opposition. While Yeltsin set about organising the resistance in Moscow, famously climbing onto a tank in front of the White House and denouncing the putsch as ‚Äòa right-wing, reactionary, anti-constitutional coup‚Äô, Sobchak took the first flight back to Leningrad, where he arrived in the middle of the afternoon..."*
    -  *"**Putin acknowledged later that ‚Äòwhen the putsch began, I had very complicated feelings. Very difficult!‚Äô On the one hand, like many Russians, he was deeply dismayed by the thought that the Soviet Union might break apart and the State Committee seemed determined to stop that. On the other, he recognised that trying to turn the clock back would solve nothing and in any case was impossible.**...For the first 36 hours, when the key decisions were taken, Putin had been, as he said himself, ‚Äòin the sticks‚Äô, completely out of the loop."*.."*
    -  *"..Although uncertainty continued until late in the afternoon, the putsch was all but over. It had not been entirely bloodless. In Moscow, on Tuesday night, three young men had been shot and crushed under the treads of an advancing tank. But they were the only victims. In Leningrad, no one died. On Wednesday evening, Gorbachev was released from house arrest at Foros and flown back to Moscow. **Politically his career was over. By trying to placate hardliners and liberals, conservatives and democrats, he had discredited himself in the eyes of both sides.** The Union Treaty was dead. After the putsch, Yeltsin saw no need for it. **What mattered were the rights of the republics: the less power for the federal centre, the better.** In the long battle with Yeltsin for pre-eminence, Gorbachev had lost. ‚ÄòA tsar must conduct himself like a tsar,‚Äô he reflected bitterly afterwards. ‚ÄòAnd that, I do not know how to do.‚Äô The Soviet Communist Party was dead, too. After Yeltsin suspended its activities in Russia, Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, called for the Party‚Äôs dissolution and decreed that all its property be placed under the control of city councils and republican parliaments.  **The KGB survived, but for a time was severely weakened. On Thursday night, the 20-foot-high bronze statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Cheka, which stood in front of the Lubyanka, was toppled from its pedestal and taken away on a flat-bed truck.**."*
    -  *"...**Aleksandr Yakovlev, the theorist of perestroika, thought he was now the most important Soviet politician after Gorbachev and Yeltsin.** ...saw him as a possible successor to Gorbachev if the Union survived. **Putin, as always, remained discreetly in the background.** In these momentous days, which would soon bring seventy years of Soviet history to an ignominious end, his role had been negligible."*
    - üìù *"**The political crisis in August briefly diverted attention from the economic crisis which had Russia by the throat and, equally briefly, made City Hall and the Lensoviet bury their differences as they faced a common enemy in the shape of the State Emergency Committee. As soon as the putsch was over, they both came roaring back. The economic crisis came first. In the 18 months since Putin had returned from Dresden, the decline in Soviet production had accelerated. Rationing of most basic foodstuffs had been imposed, supposedly on a temporary basis, the previous winter, and had not been lifted. In September 1991, Sobchak and Belyaev wrote to Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, expressing ‚Äòextreme concern‚Äô about food supplies. The Soviet distribution system was broken, they told him, and since the Baltic States had declared full independence in August, the Tallinn Process had stalled. St Petersburg, as the city was once again called ‚Äì the name change having taken effect on September 6 ‚Äì urgently needed 20,000 tons of butter and 50,000 tons of meat in humanitarian aid.**."*
    - üìù *"**Sobchak was mortified at having to make such a request ‚Äì a feeling shared by much of the city‚Äôs population: an opinion poll found that nearly half thought that asking for help from foreigners was humiliating. But he had little choice. In November he called in the city‚Äôs small diplomatic corps for what the British Consul General, Barbara Hay, called ‚Äòa begging bowl meeting‚Äô. That month, even bread and potatoes, the ultimate staples in the Russian diet, were in short supply, and there were long queues outside the few bakeries that were open. ‚ÄòThe food situation is reaching breaking point,‚Äô the French Consul reported. On November 10, the city had less than three days‚Äô supply of meat on the basis of 1.5 kgs (3.3 lbs) per month per inhabitant. The ration of ten eggs per person per month was cut to eight. Old people muttered darkly about a repetition of the blockade winter of 1941. Businessmen warned of ‚Äòa danger zone of potential social explosions where anything could happen‚Äô.Sobchak travelled to Britain, France, Germany and Spain to press the city‚Äôs case for help. Putin went with him.**."*
    - üìù *"**Eventually a trickle of foreign food aid did start arriving. But it was neither in the quantities nor of the quality that the Russians had hoped for, and, to rub salt in the wound, the donors went to embarrassing lengths to vaunt their often parsimonious contributions. The French insisted that the medical supplies that they sent to St Petersburg be stamped with the French flag, and the words, ‚ÄòFrench humanitarian aid‚Äô, in Russian. ‚ÄòThis will make the French action particularly visible to the population,‚Äô the Foreign Ministry wrote. When the Americans flew in food, mainly military rations from US bases in Germany, it was brought in by a convoy of Soviet army lorries which drove through the city centre, led by the US Consul General, Jack Gosnell, in a car flying the American flag. When Britain sent livestock feed, a British minister demanded to be present when it was unloaded. It was not an edifying spectacle. ‚ÄòThe Western countries talk a lot more than they actually do in practice,‚Äô Sobchak said glumly. There were unfounded reports that Britain was trying to palm off on Russia unsaleable meat, infected with BSE, popularly known as Mad Cow Disease, and that Germany was sending food which was close to its expiry date. St Petersburg newspaper commentary was uniformly negative.**."*
    - üìù *"**The situation was made worse when Yeltsin and his Finance Minister, Yegor Gaidar, decided that, with a few exceptions such as bread and fuel oil, price controls would be lifted in the New Year as part of what would later be known as ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô. It was an attempt to do in weeks what Gorbachev had failed to do in years ‚Äì to transform the Soviet planned economy into a free-market system, an endeavour which the American Ambassador, Jack Matlock, described as ‚Äòlike trying to convert a submarine into an airplane while keeping it functioning with the same crew throughout‚Äô. As soon as the decision became known, supplies of almost everything dried up completely. What farm or factory in its right mind would send goods to the shops when, by waiting a few weeks longer, it could sell them for ten times more?**."*
    - üìù *"**In this grim situation, Sobchak asked Putin in December 1991 to organise what amounted to an elaborate barter deal, whereby raw materials, including oil, timber and precious metals, would be exported to Western Europe and the proceeds used to purchase food for the population. Barter trade had helped keep the wheels of the Soviet economy turning for decades. In theory, the central planners took care of everything. In practice, there were always holes in the supply chain. All large state enterprises employed fixers, known as tolkachi, literally ‚Äòpushers‚Äô, to barter excess production for raw materials which the planners had failed to allocate. Never having known any other method, officials at the St Petersburg City Hall had started earlier that year trying to use the same approach with potential foreign partners.**."*
    - üìù *"**Putin‚Äôs mission was more ambitious and potentially more realistic. Instead of a direct barter arrangement, intermediaries would be used. In normal times, that would have been impossible. Foreign trade was the prerogative of the Soviet government in Moscow. But these were not normal times. The Soviet Union was falling apart. The Baltic States, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova had already left. On December 1, Ukrainians voted for independence, effectively sounding the death knell of the Union State. A week later, Yeltsin and the leaders of Belarus and Ukraine met at a hunting lodge in the Belovezha Forest, near the Belarusian‚ÄìPolish border, to sign an agreement creating the Commonwealth of Independent States, a voluntary association which would eventually bring together most, though not all, of the former Soviet republics. It was tantamount to a declaration that ‚Äúthe USSR had ceased to exist. For Yeltsin, it was a godsend: if the Soviet Union was no more, his rival would no longer have a country to preside over and his career would come to an end. Gorbachev bowed to the reality on December 25 and announced his resignation as Soviet President. The Hammer and Sickle flag flying over the Kremlin was lowered for the last time and the Russian tricolour raised in its place.**"*
    - üìù *"**In these circumstances, the usual rules no longer applied. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations told Putin to go ahead on his own, which he did. The trouble was that very little of the promised food imports ever materialised. The licensing agreements between the Foreign Relations Committee (FRC) and the intermediary import‚Äìexport companies, signed by Putin or his deputy, Aleksandr Anikin, were worth altogether 122 million US dollars. The question that was raised when the food did not arrive, and which has been constantly raised ever since, was, what happened to the money? It is worth examining the charges in detail, for it was later widely believed, both in Russia and in the West, that the episode very nearly brought Putin‚Äôs career to an early end.**."*
    - üìù *"**But appearances can be misleading. It was true that the agreements were drafted so sloppily that a high-school student could have done better, and Anikin was eventually fired for having approved them. But no one in St Petersburg had ever written a foreign trade contract before. For the City Administration, it was unknown territory, as was shown by the earlier failure of even as savvy a businessman as Georgy Khizha to set up successful barter deals. To complicate matters further, there was no established legal framework. That winter, as the Soviet Union collapsed and the new state of Russia emerged from the wreckage, no one knew for certain which laws applied. Russian laws, when they existed, and Soviet laws, when they were still in force, were frequently in conflict. Officials made it up as they went along.**."*
    - üìù *"**Large state companies were wary of engaging directly in transactions for which the legal basis was unclear, so Putin turned to friends, or friends of friends, to set up intermediary companies which could get the contracts fulfilled. That was how things worked in Russia at that time: informal networks were often the only way to get anything done, especially when, as in this case, official channels did not yet exist. In most countries, if a company registered precious metals for export at a tiny fraction of their world market price, it would send up multiple red flags. But Russia in 1992 was not like other countries. Since Soviet times, rare metals had been allocated by central planners, not traded. As there was no domestic market, there was no fixed domestic price. Andrei Illarionov, who later became Putin‚Äôs economic adviser, has argued that the very concept of price was alien to Soviet economists: the state plan was based on ‚Äòmaterial balances‚Äô in which price played no part.**."*
    - üìù *"**In any case, enterprises, like individuals, were so desperate for money during that winter that they were prepared to sell anything for whatever they could get. At a time when between 50 and 80 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line, and factories had stopped paying wages, any deal was better than nothing. Russian babushki, the eternal grandmothers who held families together, stood outside metro stations trying to sell bunches of violets or a few poor vegetables. Old men hawked family heirlooms or anything else that might bring in money. A young Western banker was invited to a meeting with a man from the military‚Äìindustrial complex, who pulled out a piece of paper covered with chemical formulae and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure you know what this is.‚Äô It turned out that he was trying to sell enriched uranium. ‚ÄòEverything was for sale,‚Äô the banker remembered. ‚ÄòYou could buy MiG fighters if you wanted.'**."*
    - üìù *"**The real problem, however, lay elsewhere. The agreements that Putin had approved were neither true barter deals nor normal commercial transactions. Once the companies had sold the exported commodities for foreign currency, even if the contracts stipulated penalties for failing to send back food, under Russian law there was no way to enforce them. The entirely foreseeable result, as Putin later acknowledged, was that some of them violated their commitments. One did not: Tamigo, a Russian‚ÄìGerman joint venture, sent back two shiploads of cooking oil. But others did as Russian companies usually did at that time if they were lucky enough to obtain export licences: they took advantage of the huge gap between the cost of raw materials in Russia and the selling price abroad, and stashed the profits in Western bank accounts.**."*
    - üìù *"...**'Salye was a very good woman, but she understood absolutely nothing about the economy. So she wrote bullshit. She wrote in her report that Putin and Sobchak sent oil and other things abroad and promised that the money would be used to buy food ‚Ä¶ But ‚Ä¶ who owned the oil and the rare metals? Who did they belong to? They belonged to different companies [which] wanted to export. But they couldn‚Äôt export without special permission. So they went to Sobchak and Putin, and they said: ‚ÄòGet us authorisation. When we have sold the goods, we will bring back food.‚Äô They sold the goods, they got the money, and they didn‚Äôt bring in food ‚Ä¶ Nobody stole anything from anybody! They were their goods, they sold them, and the money they got was theirs.'...There were ‚Äòsignificant violations‚Äô, but no more serious than happened elsewhere in Russia. ‚ÄòThis kind of thing was very typical at that time ‚Äì exporting strategic materials in exchange for food, which was then not supplied.'.**."*
    - üìù *"**The chemistry between Yeltsin and Sobchak had never been particularly good. Ever since Sobchak had emerged as a national leader during the putsch, Yeltsin had viewed him as a potential rival. But Sobchak was loyal and that was enough.**."*
    - üìù *"**Years later, when Putin rose to prominence in Moscow, the ‚Äòfood scandal‚Äô, as it became known, took on a new lease of life. It was claimed that he had come within an inch of being fired, that the amount of money involved was not 100 million but one billion US dollars, and there were veiled suggestions that a large part had ended up in Putin‚Äôs and Sobchak‚Äôs pockets. None of that was true. Some of the businessmen involved certainly made big profits and certain officials in the Mayor‚Äôs Office benefitted. But since the Customs Department had blocked all but the first shipment, the amount of money involved was far smaller than the sums originally reported.**."*
    - üìù *"**The attempted August 1991 putsch made Western governments and financial institutions uncomfortably aware that the gains of perestroika could be rolled back in the blink of an eye if a different kind of government came to power. None of them wanted to pour in money for Gorbachev and still less for Yeltsin. Talk of a Marshall Plan for Russia never got off the ground. In retrospect their reluctance was understandable, although arguably short-sighted. Russia was a black hole, it was said. To give money to a government which lacked the infrastructure to use it constructively would be tantamount to throwing it away. With an election year looming in America, the George H. W. Bush administration was wary of anything that might make it look soft towards its former Cold War adversary. Absent an American lead, Western Europeans sat on their hands. But none of them wanted, either, to see a hard-line communist government in office, and, as the coup attempt had shown, given the right conditions, that could not be ruled out. The answer, they decided, was to try to make the transition to a market economy irreversible as quickly as possible.**."*
    - üìù *"**The numbers of foreign businessmen coming to the city increased exponentially. In 1992, more than 3,000 joint ventures were registered by Putin‚Äôs Foreign Relations Committee, ten times more than in 1991. Russia became the new frontier for established Western companies wanting a foothold in what they hoped would be a vast potential market; for young start-ups which had launched businesses in Czechoslovakia, Hungary or Poland, and now sought fresh challenges further east; and for carpet-baggers and hucksters, who came to make a quick killing. St Petersburg, Russia‚Äôs traditional gateway to the West, less than two hours‚Äô drive from the Finnish border, had its fair share of all three. For most of them, Putin‚Äôs FRC was the first port of call. Sobchak had given him broad authority, and from the outset, Putin saw his role in expansive terms. As well as foreign trade and investment, he was in charge of hotel development and tourism, humanitarian aid, and liaison with foreign consulates in the city. Later he would also be given responsibility for the city‚Äôs main airport at Pulkovo; the St Petersburg Oil Port; foreign television broadcasts re-transmitted in St Petersburg; and foreign financial institutions**."*
    - üìù *"**Banking, along with the establishment of the Free Enterprise Zone, was among Sobchak‚Äôs fetishes. He had visions of making St Petersburg the financial capital of Russia. Even if some of Putin‚Äôs obligations were more notional than real, it was a formidable list of responsibilities. He travelled widely, mainly within Europe but also to countries further afield, including Turkey, the US and Canada. When Sobchak received foreign visitors, Putin was a discreet presence sitting unobtrusively to one side...In October 1991, even before the FRC was properly up and running, he was given a further assignment: to control the gambling business in St Petersburg, including casinos and slot machines, the ‚Äòone-armed bandits‚Äô which were proliferating in the city.**."*
    - *"...'Putin‚Äôs great weakness is his office, disorganisation reigns and there are papers flying everywhere.' In one sense, that was in character. Putin‚Äôs old teacher, Vera Gurevich, used to complain that, as a student, his desk was always a mess, until suddenly it was not and she learnt that he had joined the KGB. But something else was at work, too. Russian bosses usually rule with the knout. That was not Putin‚Äôs way. Marina Yentaltseva remembered that the first day he came to the office, she was in the middle of putting on lipstick. She assumed that she would be fired on the spot. Instead, he pretended not to notice. It was un-Russian, or at least, atypical. She did not know quite what to make of it. Many of Putin‚Äôs Russian colleagues, including those who had little time for Sobchak and his administration, regarded him as an impressive operator. Pokrovsky, who later resigned from City Hall in disgust, said that **he had ‚Äòa keen mind, he settles everything quickly and has a professional grasp of things‚Äô.** Aleksandr Belyaev, while stating frankly, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like Mr Putin‚Äô, acknowledged that **he understands how to cooperate with people, how to use them in his interest‚Äô.** Even Valery Pavlov, who, when they worked together, found him **‚Äòclosed and secretive, never giving anything away‚Äô**, noted that he had quickly brought whole swathes of the administration under his control. Foreigners found him much harder to fathom. **The commonest reaction was not to notice that he was there at all.** Western ambassadors visiting from Moscow would say later, **‚ÄòI have absolutely no recollection of him. None whatsoever. I must have shaken hands with him ‚Äì but absolutely no memory.‚Äô** Jaakko Kalela, who served as National Security Adviser to a succession of Finnish presidents, recalled that whenever Putin came with Sobchak to Helsinki, **‚Äòhe somehow disappeared into the wallpaper‚Äô**."*
    - *"...**He looked tired, he didn‚Äôt seem in a very good mood, and he said, ‚ÄòI saw your presentation. I get it. We don‚Äôt need to go through it.‚Äô I was pretty grumpy because I‚Äôd worked hard on this, [so] I said, ‚ÄòReally! Tell me, what do you get?‚Äô Then he got really annoyed, and he said ‚Äì ‚ÄòI‚Äôll tell you what I get. **We‚Äôre new to power. We want to stay in power. Staying in power means providing people with practical benefits from our period in power, which basically means jobs. Jobs require capital. We don‚Äôt have any of that just now and foreigners do. So that requires foreigners. And foreigners require tax breaks. So tax breaks mean we stay in power.'** ‚ÄòAlright‚Äô, Ryan conceded, suitably deflated: ‚ÄòI guess you do get it.‚Äô **Putin‚Äôs approach, he thought afterwards, was totally pragmatic. The Gillette project went ahead and became one of the more successful joint ventures in the city.**....If Putin looked perpetually tired, it was because he was. Most days he left the dacha early in the morning and did not return until midnight. His workload was crippling. As another young American official put it, **‚Äòhe was the man who made the trains run on time for Sobchak'**."*
    - *"...These were not techniques which Putin had learnt with the KGB. **Forcing supplicants to wait was an old Russian bureaucratic tactic to assert superiority. Putin kept people waiting, unless there was an imperative reason to be punctual, because he could. Being on time brought no benefit and required effort which he could expend elsewhere**..."*
    - *"..But Sedelmayer, an expansive, outgoing man, ten years Putin‚Äôs junior, who had come to Russia to sell counter-terrorism equipment and training programmes for the police, **was the rare foreigner who managed to get beyond the unyielding fa√ßade, and over the next few years he and Putin developed an unusually warm relationship**. Putin was fascinated by the state-of-the-art equipment which Sedelmayer was bringing in. ...in the early 1990s Sedelmayer got closer to Putin than any other Westerner, although even he found there were limits: **'He was curious and of course, observant ‚Ä¶ And he was always in control, both of himself and the situation ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôd project himself differently to different people. He was chameleon-like. He‚Äôd give them back a mirror image of what he thought they‚Äôd like to see. He was ‚Ä¶ good at eliciting information from people, but reserved when talking about others ‚Ä¶ He was not a person who opened up. [He kept] his private life private ‚Ä¶ He continually kept a wall between people he knew and his family. [He] never talked about his parents, he never talked about his wife ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt remember a single occasion when I had the feeling he was telling me anything revealing about his personal past.**."*
    - *"...Von Puttkamer also found that **Putin preferred to talk of practical things, never anything personal. There was ‚Äòa door that he never opened‚Äô, he recalled. ‚ÄòHe is not a man to show his inner being.‚Äô Putin was best with small groups, Sedelmayer said, ‚Äòone on one, or one on two or three. He was an individualist, not a team player.**."*
    - *"...‚Äúhere was a simple answer. Along with the plethora of adjectives used by foreigners who tried to describe his character ‚Äì **‚Äòquiet and nondescript; businesslike and pragmatic; cold, distant, reserved and evasive; calculating, not spontaneous; wily and tough‚Äô ‚Äì Putin was shy. Most of his close Russian friends did not see it. But outside his own small circle, socialising did not come naturally to him. As Lyudmila put it, ‚Äòhe had to work hard to seem at ease with people.‚Äô However, that was only one side of Putin. Just as, when a schoolboy, he had always tried not to stand out, yet at the same time, by small signs, had asserted his difference**..."*
    - *"...his relations with Lyudmila were erratic. Like Sobchak, who was famously unfaithful, Putin‚Äôs eye was still prone to wander..."*
    - *"It was partly luck, partly being in the right place at the right time and partly skilled manoeuvring. **Putin knew how to make himself indispensable, discreetly positioning himself so that if an opening arose, he was the obvious, indeed the only choice to fill it. It was a pattern which would repeat itself often in his career.**"*
    - üìù *"**At the beginning of 1993, a political storm was brewing in Moscow. Yeltsin was at war with the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Congress of People‚Äôs Deputies, which had refused to confirm Gaidar, his choice as Prime Minister and, since the previous summer, had systematically blocked his efforts at reform. It had started as an attempt by the opposition to capitalise on public discontent over ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô but quickly degenerated into a bare-knuckled struggle for power. The Chairman of the Soviet, Ruslan Khasbulatov, an economics professor from Chechnya with a talent for political intrigue, was determined to wrest back from Yeltsin the powers which the Congress had conferred on him in the euphoria of Russian independence in 1991. Yeltsin was just as determined not to give them up. In March, his Vice President, Aleksandr Rutskoi, threw in his lot with Khasbulatov and Yeltsin barely survived an impeachment attempt. Gaidar thought the country was edging towards civil war.**."*
    - üìù *"**On September 21, he proclaimed the dissolution of both the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People‚Äôs Deputies and announced new elections for December. The decision, he acknowledged later, was illegal. But there was no choice. The alternative, he told Russians, was ‚Äòthe disintegration of the Russian state, [and] chaos in a country which has an enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons‚Äô**...Shcherbakov appeared on television and accused both Sobchak and Yeltsin of acting like dictators ‚Äì the next step, he said, would be civil war."*
    - üìù *"**In Tverskaya Street, a mob commandeered two army trucks and smashed down the doors of the City Hall. Another group of heavily armed men occupied the Television Centre at Ostankino, in the north of the city. It began to look like a repetition of 1917, when a few thousand Bolsheviks had overthrown the Kerensky government, installing a dictatorship which had lasted for 70 years. That night, Gaidar broadcast an emotional appeal to Muscovites to come to the square, outside the Mayor‚Äôs Office, ‚Äòto stand together to defend our future and the future of our children, and not to allow our country to be turned once again into an enormous concentration camp for decades to come ‚ÄúAs they had during the putsch two years earlier, people responded. By midnight, 20,000 to 30,000 had gathered. Volunteer detachments formed, vowing to defend Yeltsin‚Äôs government. In the end, however, it was the army which saved the day.**."*
    - üìù *"**After further attempts at negotiation failed, a dozen heavy T-72 tanks were brought up and fired 12 shells at the upper storeys. Ten were blanks, two were live. With the top four floors on fire, groups of deputies and their aides, carrying white flags, walked out and were allowed to go free. Even then, it was not quite over. Armed extremists, who escaped with their weapons through underground passageways, continued to pick off soldiers and civilians seemingly at random. Sniper fire continued all night. Officially 187 people were killed in the conflict and up to a thousand wounded. Unofficial accounts suggested the figure may have been far higher.**."*

    - Chapter 6 - The Grey Cardinal - *"...if, for instance, he had deliberately attached himself to Sobchak on the KGB‚Äôs instructions; if he had worked for the hated Fifth Directorate, targeting political dissent; or if he had been a stukach, a KGB informer. In the interview, Putin went out of his way to insist that none of that could be true. He had always worked for the KGB‚Äôs ‚Äòelite‚Äô foreign intelligence service, he claimed, and had had ‚Äòno connection with domestic political problems‚Äô, an area in which, he told Chas pik, the KGB had behaved ‚Äòmonstrously‚Äô....The first answer was a lie: he had spent several years working for the Fifth Department."*
    - *"....**‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt know who he‚Äôs working for, we don‚Äôt know whose side he‚Äôs on.‚Äô Sedelmayer was intrigued. ‚ÄòIt was fascinating,‚Äô he said later. ‚ÄòPutin was perfectly grey concerning his intentions.'**."*
    - *"....Putin himself said that ‚Äòit tore my life apart‚Äô. That was hyperbole, like his claim that during the putsch, ‚Äòall the ideals, all the goals that I had had when I went to work for the KGB, collapsed.‚Äô Those illusions had been lost much earlier. All the same, it had been a harrowing choice. He had discussed it with his friend who told him bluntly: ‚ÄòYou can stop working for this organisation, but its world view and way of thinking will remain stuck in your head.‚Äô But in the end what mattered was that he had found a pragmatic compromise.."*
    - *"...The years in the KGB were not the only baggage Putin carried from his past. Some of his childhood friends from the courtyard had gone on to a life of crime. In the judo clubs, he had been surrounded by criminals...Some of these men, while prodigious sportsmen, were simply bandits. Others were more complicated characters.."*
    - üìù *"**If the frontiers were blurred, it was because, in the Soviet Union, any form of private business was a criminal offence. Every Russian businessman who rose to prominence in the early 1990s, including those who became billionaires, started by trading illegally. There was no other way. Even after Gorbachev allowed the formation of cooperatives, what was lawful and what was not depended on the whim of the local Party leader. In one city, old women were allowed to sell vegetables. In another, they were not. The classic route to riches was to buy jeans, or rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll records, from foreigners studying at Soviet universities, or from tourists or Third World diplomats, and sell them on the black market. With the capital thus accumulated, the bolder of the nascent entrepreneurs moved on to buying and selling computers and electronic equipment, also acquired initially from foreigners or through back-door deals with Soviet factories. Others, with better connections, obtained seed money from the Komsomol or reached under-the-counter agreements with state-owned enterprises. Eventually, cooperatives and, later on, private individuals, were allowed to open bank accounts and to conduct foreign trade directly. Huge fortunes could then be made by playing on the difference between domestic and foreign commodity prices and exchange-rate differentials.**"*
    - üìù *"**Almost all Russian businesses in St Petersburg paid for protection in one form or another, either directly to organised crime groups or to private security companies with links to organised crime. The old Soviet-era underground, founded in the labour camps, with a strict code of conduct ruled by so-called Vory v zakone, ‚ÄòThieves in Law‚Äô, who disdained any dealings with the authorities, was forced out by newer, more violent groups ‚Äì the Chechen mafia and the Malyshev, Kazansky and Tambovsky gangs, 60 per cent of whose members came from boxing and judo clubs. Gangsters used rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank mines and remote-controlled car bombs as well as Kalashnikovs and machine guns. In 1995, the per capita murder rate in St Petersburg exceeded that in New York. In Russia as a whole, it was between two and four times higher than in the United States. The police estimated that 30 to 40 per cent of the killings in St Petersburg were the work of hitmen.**."*
    - üìù *"**The intensity of the gang warfare in St Petersburg, which reached a peak in 1994 and 1995, was the most dramatic manifestation of the breakdown of law and order which accompanied the transition to a market economy, but there were plenty of other signs that society had lost its moorings. Petty crime and street mugging were a daily hazard. Nearly 80 per cent of the adult population said they felt it was dangerous to walk in the streets, and 90 per cent said that the fight against crime should be the administration‚Äôs first priority...Prostitution and drug abuse assumed epic proportions. At one high school, one in six of the girls in the senior classes said they wished to work as prostitutes after graduation...With a population of five million, St Petersburg was officially stated to have one million alcoholics and 300,000 drug addicts ‚Äì no doubt an exaggeration but perhaps not by very much.**.."*
    - üìù *"**Not only was crime endemic, but the borderline between the criminal world and legitimate business was porous....almost everyone in his generation could have gone one way or the other: 'I have friends, close friends, who went into crime ‚Ä¶ I saw how people who were close to me were killed. Business at that time was always absolutely on the edge ‚Äì at the border between business and banditism. It was a choice ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì and I will never know ‚Äì if I made the right choice. I don‚Äôt know what would have happened had I chosen the other route.'..It was a choice not only for businessmen but for officials. The temptations were immense. ‚ÄòAn honest policeman may soon become a rarity,‚Äô grumbled Sankt-Peterburgskie vedomosti. ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs running the country?‚Äô asked the national newspaper, Izvestia. ‚ÄòThe government? Or clans of organised criminals?'.**"*
    - *"...Russia was living through the same experiences as the United States, a century before: **Any bureaucratic system has its own specific properties. One of them is the sale of decisions for money. Each person sells what he has. Bureaucrats sell decisions. In other words, they take bribes. This is not because of some moral deficiency on their part. It is an objective property of any system of power in which morality is absent.'** To understand St Petersburg, one needed only to read Lincoln Steffens‚Äôs essay, ‚ÄòTweed Days in St. Louis‚Äô, describing municipal corruption in early twentieth-century Missouri."*
    - üìù *"...In a survey of 43 countries by the World Economic Forum in Davos, Russia came overall bottom for state sector bribery, bureaucratic obstruction and the financial and political risks of doing business. **In St Petersburg, bribery was no longer thought of as something criminal. It was ‚Äòpart of the fabric of life ‚Äì a fact that is taken for granted‚Äô...Bribes were paid ‚Äòin every imaginable form: roubles, dollars, apartments, motor cars, foreign holidays, or anything else. Just as varied is the range of services provided by the bribetakers ‚Äì from long-term leases on property to licences to export raw materials to a favourable verdict in court.‚Äô....This was the atmosphere in which Putin worked. The criminal world and the world of legitimate business ‚Äì or business which hoped to become legitimate ‚Äì were symbiotic, not merely linked but inextricably intertwined.**..."*
    - *"...**None of Sobchak‚Äôs deputies could have done their jobs without channels to organised crime. Putin was particularly closely involved because he was responsible for security in the city.**...was to try to maintain a balance between the leading gangs to ensure that none became dominant...Whenever a foreign businessman had difficulties with Russian criminals, the consulates turned to Putin for help."*
    - *"...**Putin‚Äôs approach to the Subway affair, to try to seek a resolution by way of an informal compromise, rather than through the courts, was standard practice in Russia.**...In other cases, where both sides could find an interest, the City Administration and organised crime cooperated more fruitfully....**'There was a very simple conversation. Kumarin said [to the Directors of Surgutneftegaz]: ‚ÄòI have a suggestion. Let us own this property jointly ‚Äì it will be useful, it will be a good thing. There are two possible answers: yes or no. If it‚Äôs no, in a month or two, you will be killed.‚Äô He wasn‚Äôt coming in just as a gangster, he was bringing his money, his connections, his services, to make a business. But for something that big, without the government, you couldn‚Äôt do it. So you had to negotiate with the bureaucrats as well.'**....**Kumarin‚Äôs move from banditry to participation in legitimate, or quasi-legitimate, business, was part of a general trend in the second half of the 1990s.**....**Like many others at that time, he straddled the borderline between legitimate business and the black market.**.."*
    - üìù *"**Russians had had to learn to use informal networks to sort out problems among themselves because in Soviet, as in tsarist, times, the justice system, in so far as there was one, had been a political instrument. It was only when a problem involved foreigners, who, by definition, could not be part of Russian networks and did not understand the Russian way of doing things, that recourse would be had to the courts, and even then as a last resort.**."*
    - *"..Businessmen had learnt which officials had to be bribed in order to get things done. As Yevgeny Vyshenkov put it, with only mild exaggeration: **‚ÄòAt that time, everybody took. It would be like saying that you fought in the Second World War for five years and did not kill anyone ‚Ä¶ Everyone took. But [they did so] to different degrees.'**...The commonest form of corruption concerned real estate. Even in Soviet times, officials in resort towns like Sestroretsk had grown fat on bribes for authorising the construction of dachas. In St Petersburg, where two out of five families still lived in workers‚Äô hostels or communal apartments and people waited decades to obtain even a modest apartment of their own, the pressure on housing was intense...More than 90 per cent were people who ‚Äòknew someone‚Äô, who ‚Äòhad a relative who could help‚Äô, who could offer a favour in return or who simply bribed the relevant officials. For the most part, this took place at the district level, but it reached up into the Mayor‚Äôs Office as well. When the Legislative Assembly attempted to clean up the system, Sobchak was furious. It was far too useful an instrument of patronage for the administration to give up."*
    - *"..**In Russia, there is an important difference between an official who takes bribes, and one who accepts a recompense from a businessman he has helped.** According to the St Petersburg historian, Dmitry Travin, it is a distinction which goes back to tsarist times. Many Russian officials, and not just then, but now, too, don‚Äôt think that it is wrong to take kickbacks, they think it is just a legitimate return for the help they give to business. It‚Äôs a moral question. In seventeenth-century Russia, there were two expressions for bribes: mzdoimstvo [donations] and likhoimstvo [extortion]. Mzdoimstvo was the proper sum of money for the official‚Äôs help ‚Äì it was accepted, and it was not subject to discussion, because officials never lived just on their salary. The expression is no longer used, but the idea [has survived]. It means that you can take your rightful due and that is fine. Likhoimstvo means asking much too much."*
    - *"..Putin argued that bribe-taking was unacceptable, but on slightly different grounds. ‚ÄòThe person who gives a bribe,‚Äô he said, soon after becoming deputy Mayor, ‚Äòalways humiliates the person who accepts it. Self-esteem, respect for one‚Äôs own worth, is extremely important, in my view.‚Äô **Respect was fundamental for Putin. Whether for himself as a boy in Baskov Lane or for Russia as a great power, the need to be respected was a constant principle all his life.**."*
    - *"...**Most of the people who worked with Putin in St Petersburg have since maintained that he did not take bribes, at least not in the sense of likhoimstvo. That is probably true...Putin was one of the few officials in the Mayor‚Äôs Office who were clean...Berezovsky was astonished. ‚ÄòHe was the first bureaucrat who did not take bribes,‚Äô he told, 'Seriously. It made a huge impression on me.'...These anecdotes can be read at several levels. Taken literally, they were the marks of an incorruptible public servant. Yet Putin‚Äôs refusal of even a lunch invitation leaves the impression that he was protesting too much. Likewise his refusal to accept Berezovsky‚Äôs offer of a car. What Berezovsky had proposed was not a bribe per se, but mzdoimstvo, a ‚Äòdonation‚Äô ‚Äì a distinction which Putin well understood. His reaction seemed rather to stem from distrust. He sensed, probably correctly, that if he accepted anything from the tycoon, he would be making himself vulnerable and it might later be used against him. With people whom he trusted and who he could be sure would be discreet, Putin behaved differently.**..."*
    - *"...divided Russian bureaucrats into three categories: 'You had A‚Äôs, B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs. The A‚Äôs did not take money ‚Ä¶ They were chickenshit or it was just not their style. There was a very small group of them. The B‚Äôs, who are the largest ‚Äúgroup, were generally speaking there for public service, but would have felt like idiots if they didn‚Äôt at least create a pension for themselves. So they would do the odd deal to make sure that they had some kind of financial cushion, but they were largely speaking doing government service. The C‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt lift a pen without getting paid. And I saw people make the transition. I saw people essentially start out as A minuses, and become B‚Äôs. I saw people that were B‚Äôs become C‚Äôs'...**Putin was a solid ‚ÄòB‚Äô. He ‚Äòtook‚Äô, as Yevgeny Vyshenkov put it, as did almost every official in St Petersburg, but as mzdoimstvo ‚Äì gratuities, not bribes ‚Äì discreetly and on a modest scale.**.."*
    - üìù *"**It was a world in which all the barriers were fluid, where yesterday‚Äôs criminal was tomorrow‚Äôs business magnate and a politician today was a criminal tomorrow. Putin understood that mindset.**."*
    - *"...**To be surrounded by shady characters is not in itself a crime and, in Putin‚Äôs case, it was at a time when, in Russia, the distinction between politicians, businessmen and criminals was almost completely effaced. But it also reflected Putin‚Äôs willingness to overlook deviant behaviour when it was in his interests to do so.**.."*
    - *"...**gaining a reputation as ‚Äòthe most closed figure in the city government'...Most of the other leaders were accessible. ‚ÄòPutin was totally different. He would always try to escape the social part of an event. He tried to avoid all contact.‚Äô On the rare occasions when he had to give a news conference, he usually contented himself with a short statement and then left. It was not because he could not hold his own. If cornered, he was capable of talking animatedly and at length about the city‚Äôs affairs while saying absolutely nothing that was newsworthy. ‚ÄòHe spoke extremely well. His diction was marvellous. Most of the leaders at that time mangled their words and spoke ungrammatically. Putin spoke like a member of the Leningrad intelligentsia. He used literary phrases, elegant constructions ‚Ä¶ But when you read it back, it was like a blank tape.'**.."*
    - *"...A normally concerned husband, on learning that his wife had just had a serious car accident, would drop everything and rush off to make sure that she was all right. Putin did not. He knew that she had been badly hurt...Yet he stubbornly carried on with his work. It was not because he did not care. His daughter had also been in the car. But he did not break off the talks to go to her side either. The self-discipline that he had developed in his childhood had become a default position. His response to any untoward event was to suppress his emotions, wearing an impenetrable mask behind which everything was hidden....Occasionally, for no obvious reason, his feelings would creep up on him and take him unawares. Then the mask would drop. **In the winter of 1994, when Yeltsin sent the Russian army, largely made up of untrained conscripts, to Chechnya to try to suppress the separatist rebellion there, Putin, as the deputy Mayor responsible for security affairs, was at the airport when the first body bags started coming back from the front. The German Consul, who also happened to be there, was astonished to see that he was on the verge of tears.**....More typical was his reaction when their sheepdog, Malysh, burrowed beneath the fence of the dacha and was hit by a passing car...For years after, he would not get another dog out of loyalty to Malysh. But he refused to let it show. It was all bottled up inside."*
    - *"...It was clear, she thought, that Putin was the dominant partner in their marriage and that Lyudmila lived in his shadow. But the relationship was complicated. On the one hand, Lyudmila insisted that Vladimir was ‚Äòexactly the right man for me ‚Ä¶ I cannot imagine a better one. He doesn‚Äôt drink and he doesn‚Äôt beat me‚Äô ‚Äì a remark which astonished her hostess but was evidently something which could not be said of all Russian husbands. On the other hand, Lyudmila, who, like many Russians, was a firm believer in astrology, told her that, ‚Äòunfortunately‚Äô, Volodya must have been born under the sign of the Vampire. She was direct and incapable of subterfuge; he was the opposite. At times, Lyudmila said, when she tried to work out what he was thinking, ‚ÄòVolodya‚Äôs eyes were empty.‚Äô But Lyudmila was not the easiest person either. ‚ÄòAnyone who can spend three weeks with that woman deserves a monument,‚Äô Putin grumbled."*
    - *"....By writing a tell-all book about Sobchak, Shutov had shown disrespect and disloyalty. **Putin esteemed respect and loyalty above all else.** His relationship with the security services meant it would have been easy for him to arrange for off-duty officers to intervene. When aroused, he did not shy away from threatening violence: his promise to ‚Äòbreak Berezovsky‚Äôs legs‚Äô was an example. Whether or not Sobchak was aware of his intentions, it would not have been out of character for Putin to have decided that Shutov needed to be stopped."*
    - *"...Sobchak was not greedy. He did not own a Mercedes or a BMW, any more than Putin did, and he avoided the ostentation associated with the ‚Äònew Russians‚Äô. But he loved foreign travel, he liked to live well and he had a succession of mistresses to support. His wife, Lyudmila Narusova, adored designer clothes, which, in Russia, cost as much as they did in the West....None of these things were affordable on Sobchak‚Äôs official salary. But it was his apartment, filled with antiques, many of them provided by Ilya Traber, overlooking the Moika River in a fashionable area near the city centre, which would prove his biggest liability.."*
    - *"...Sobchak had bent the rules to authorise projects for Renaissance, including the renovation of an apartment block on Ryleyeva Street, in the northern part of the city, so the refurbishment was in fact a disguised kickback. As in the case of the building where Putin lived, on Vasilevsky Island, most of the Ryleyeva Street apartments had been allocated not to those who had waited for years in the housing queue but to officials and their relations. The Legislative Assembly had protested, but since this kind of thing was happening all over Russia in the 1990s, it was not, in itself, a major scandal..."*
    - *"...Sobchak had announced the previous spring that he intended to stand again as Mayor, or Governor, as the post would now be called.150 Although he started as clear favourite, there were signs that he would face strong headwinds, many of his own making. His strength was as an orator. But the novelty had worn off...'The first time you heard him speak, it almost brought tears to your eyes. And then the second time, you were like, wow, that‚Äôs great, but very similar to the first time. And about the eighth or ninth time, you were thinking, ‚ÄúGive me a break!‚Äù‚Äô Like a souffl√© which collapses as it cools, there was a lot of hot air and little substance..."*
    - *"..Sobchak charmed foreigners. But he had a remarkable ability to put his Russian colleagues‚Äô backs up. The Legislative Assembly deputy, Dmitry Zapolsky, remembered: ‚ÄòHe was able to do one thing to perfection: he made enemies out of people who would otherwise have been his friends. It took no more than five minutes ‚Ä¶ He treated everyone without exception as an underperforming student.‚Äô....thought it was because ‚Äòhe regarded everyone as a rival ‚Ä¶ even his own allies.‚Äô...'We have exchanged the dictatorship of the [Communist Party] for the dictatorship of Sobchak.‚Äô...The business community soon concluded that he was ‚Äòa hopeless manager. He makes promises and nothing gets done.'...."*
    - *"...Even Putin, who made a fetish of loyalty to Sobchak, acknowledged that he needlessly antagonised others, especially the army and the security services. ‚ÄòThe generals really loathed him,‚Äô Putin said..."*
    - *"..‚ÄúAs 1995 drew to a close, 50,000 people in St Petersburg were homeless and a million others risked finding themselves on the street from one day to the next. One family in 25 had what Russians considered a ‚Äònormal‚Äô standard of living; one in a hundred could take a holiday abroad. The rest were either poor, very poor or destitute. To compound the sense of despair, those who did have a little money frequently fell victim to Ponzi schemes...The suicide rate in St Petersburg was among the highest in the world. Tuberculosis, diphtheria and dysentery had reappeared. Average life expectancy in the city had fallen from 72 in 1987 to 64 eight years later. Basic services were collapsing, sometimes literally..."*
    - üìù *"...In the early ‚Äô90s, the slump in industrial production was steeper than during the Second World War. Privatisation was widely seen as a gigantic swindle, like ‚Äòa drunkard in the street selling off his belongings for a pittance‚Äô....**had argued that it did not matter who bought privatised enterprises, they would eventually end up in the right hands ‚Äì a proposition known as the Coase theorem.** **To that end, every Russian citizen was issued a privatisation voucher with a nominal value of 10,000 roubles. If the idea was to make Russia a nation of shareholders, it was a spectacular failure. Inflation eroded the vouchers‚Äô value and most people sold them, for the equivalent of a bottle of vodka or less, to touts acting on behalf of factory directors or ‚Äònew Russian‚Äô businessmen. Putin said afterwards that he could not remember what he had bought with his voucher but it was surely ‚Äòsomething stupid‚Äô. That was true of many others. The result was asset-stripping, surging inequality and the emergence of a small group of billionaire entrepreneurs. Chubais maintained later that there had been no alternative. Unlike in Eastern Europe, where communism had taken root only after World War II and elements of a market system had survived, in Russia, except among the criminal fraternity, every entrepreneurial instinct had been extirpated by 70 years of Bolshevik rule. Whether or not the reforms could have been conducted differently is beside the point. That was the way they were carried out and, in the mid 1990s, they were desperately unpopular.**.."*
    - *"...A year later, the rift widened when **Sobchak denounced as ‚Äòinsane‚Äô Yeltsin‚Äôs decision to send the army to Chechnya. It was ‚Äòa means of covering up the incompetence of the political, military and special services, ‚Ä¶ another outrage to the long-suffering Chechen people ‚Ä¶ and a threat to human rights everywhere in Russia.‚Äô Many Russians agreed.**."*
    - *"...But then Sobchak suggested that the Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, would be a better candidate than Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential election. He was not alone in that view. Yeltsin‚Äôs popularity was at rock bottom: opinion polls gave him 10 per cent of voting intentions. Russian democrats were horrified by his conduct of the Chechen War. Some felt that it had become morally impossible to support him, whatever the consequences. Yeltsin was drinking heavily..."*
    - üìù *"...**That set off alarm bells not only in the Kremlin but in the United States, where President Clinton, who was also facing an election in 1996, had no desire to see a Communist-led government return to power in Russia. European leaders felt the same. So did the leading Russian business magnates. All, in different ways, did what they could to prevent that happening. Clinton put pressure on the IMF to disburse aid which had been delayed. The French President, Jacques Chirac, provided a secret loan of 1.5 billion US dollars, and Germany 3.5 billion, to be used to pay pension arrears and finance other social needs.1 The businessmen, meeting in February at the World Economic Forum in Davos, agreed to provide Yeltsin with all the media and financial resources they could muster.**..."*
    - *"...Most Russians took the view at that time ‚Äì and many still do today ‚Äì that politicians‚Äô wives should keep in the background. Narusova refused to remain, as she put it, ‚Äòin my husband‚Äôs shadow‚Äô, and like Raisa Gorbachev, she was hated for it...."*
    - *"...Sobchak appeared as usual in an elegant professorial suit and began reeling off statistics demonstrating his achievements. Yakovlev was in shirtsleeves and a tie, but no jacket, giving the appearance of a down-to-earth, practical man who would eschew high-sounding phrases and simply get things done. When he spoke, it was to ram that message home. Yakovlev‚Äôs image maker, Aleksandr Yershov, who was in the studio with them, said that ‚Äòafter about 20 minutes, I realised we would win.'..."*
    - üìù *"**The 1996 elections were a watershed, both for Putin and for Russia. Had Sobchak won in St Petersburg, Putin would probably have remained at his side and, three and a half years later, Yeltsin would have chosen a different successor. For Russia, the means by which Yeltsin had achieved victory had consequences which were no less far-reaching. In 1993, when Yeltsin had used the army to crush an insurgent but lawfully elected parliament, claiming that he had no choice because Russia was becoming ungovernable, Western governments had supported him, even though employing armed force to suppress political opposition was a flagrant violation of democratic principles. The new constitution, approved later that year, had provided a framework for authoritarian rule, a top-down system of government that would later be called the ‚Äòpower vertical‚Äô, in which, in theory at least, the President issued instructions and the machinery of state ensured that they were carried out.**."*
    - üìù *"**The 1996 elections took that to a whole new level. To ensure that there would be no return to communist rule, the United States and other Western governments aided Yeltsin‚Äôs re-election campaign. In one sense, this was nothing new. Throughout the Cold War, both Russia and the US had tried to influence elections in states belonging to the opposite camp. But this was the first time that the West had tried directly to influence the outcome of voting in Russia itself. The methods employed were for the most part within the bounds of normal inter-state relations: secret loans, accelerated disbursement of IMF assistance, an official visit by President Clinton during the election campaign, and the sending, at the Russian side‚Äôs request, of American electoral strategists to advise Yeltsin‚Äôs campaign. Nonetheless, a precedent had been created which, 20 years later, would come back to haunt Americans ‚Äì or should have done, had anyone remembered it.**"*
    - üìù *"**The television channels, ORT and NTV, did not merely support Yeltsin. They blackened his communist opponents with every kind of calumny imaginable. In an era when, in the West, ‚Äòfake news‚Äô has become the rallying cry of scoundrels of every stripe, that may sound quaint. But in Russia in the 1990s, journalists had been trying painfully, if not always successfully, to honour their newfound freedoms. That principled approach received a near-fatal blow in the 1996 election campaign. ‚ÄòThe age of innocence passed,‚Äô said Vladimir Pozner, one of the country‚Äôs leading television journalists. ‚ÄòEverything that has happened since had its roots there.‚Äô Aven concurred. ‚ÄòIt laid down to a large extent the basis of the system which we have today,‚Äô he wrote in 2019. Russia‚Äôs departure from what the West considered to be democratic norms did not start with Putin. It began in the 1990s, when America‚Äôs friend, Boris Yeltsin, was in power.**."*
    - Chapter 7 - The View from the Neva - *"..Sobchak was emotional, Putin said, and ‚Äòliked to be the centre of attention‚Äô. He was complicated, unnecessarily blunt, did not care what people thought of him and was careless of the consequences of his actions. Working with Sobchak had taught him not to give hostages to fortune; not needlessly to antagonise others; and, in politics as in life, not to ‚Äòspit against the wind‚Äô."*
    - üìù *"..**Putin‚Äôs approach to politics was fashioned to a large extent by observing Sobchak‚Äôs mistakes. He tried to avoid making enemies. With rare exceptions, he weighed each decision minutely and went ahead only when he had convinced himself that the balance of advantage was in his favour. Where possible, he avoided actions which would antagonise public opinion or his core supporters....his convictions about foreign policy ‚Äì and about the future of Russia ‚Äì were shaped during the years he spent with Sobchak at Smolny. The seminal event in the lives of most Russians at that time was the break-up of the Soviet Union. Putin was no exception. In a television interview in February 1992, six weeks after the Soviet flag had been lowered at the Kremlin for the last time, he set out his ideas: 'We need to see history as it was, and this [Soviet period] cannot be deleted from our history ‚Ä¶ [Communism was] harmful because the ‚Ä¶ attempt to put it into practice in our country caused enormous damage ‚Ä¶ [That is the root of] the tragedy that we are experiencing today, the tragedy of the collapse of our state ‚Ä¶ It was precisely those people in October 1917 who laid a time bomb under this edifice, the edifice of a unitary state, which was called Russia. They divided our homeland into separate territories, which previously did not even appear on the map of the globe. They endowed these territories with governments and parliaments. And now we have what we have ‚Ä¶ At the same time, they destroyed everything that brings together and rallies the peoples of civilised countries, namely they destroyed market relations ‚Ä¶ they destroyed nascent capitalism. The only thing they had to keep the country within common borders was barbed wire. And as soon as this barbed wire was removed, the country fell apart. I think this is largely the fault of those people [who made the Bolshevik Revolution]. Is that what they wanted? I don‚Äôt think so. But objectively, that was the negative role that they played'...The lesson, Putin thought, was that Russia, or what was left of it, must remain united at all costs.**.."*
    - *"...**a frozen conflict would begin, similar to that in Transnistria, where the Russian-speaking minority had fought a brief war of secession from Moldova a year earlier and founded an unrecognised independent state with its capital at Tiraspol.**..."*
    - *"...The experience started him thinking more deeply about the rest of the post-Soviet space, for which Russian commentators were still trying to come up with an appropriate name. Sankt-Peterburgskie vedomosti had launched a rubric, entitled the ‚ÄòNearer Abroad‚Äô; Chas pik referred to the ‚ÄòNew Abroad‚Äô and then, the ‚ÄòNearest Abroad‚Äô, before finally deciding: **‚ÄòOther countries have neighbours, Russia has the Near Abroad.‚Äô** **The Near Abroad stuck. It covered an area extending from the Baltic States to Central Asia and from Ukraine to the Caspian Sea. Putin knew that the former Soviet empire had been held together by brute force. But he preferred to think of the shared heritage of the post-Soviet states. ‚ÄòWe are all members of one economic community,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòHistorically our peoples have a great deal in common ‚Äì kinship, cultural links, a common history and common problems.'**."*
    - *"...**Ukraine lay at the heart of that shared history. The Russian state traced its origins to Kievan Rus, founded in the ninth century with its capital first in Novgorod, then in Kyiv. In 1991, Ukraine‚Äôs insistence on independence precipitated the Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse. Afterwards, throughout the 1990s, the flashpoint was Crimea. One bone of contention was the future of the Black Sea fleet, based at Sevastopol. Another was Crimea‚Äôs political status, because two thirds of its 2.4 million inhabitants were Russians. ‚ÄòBlood can flow there at any moment,‚Äô a Russian newspaper warned in 1992. Crimea, wrote another, risked becoming ‚Äòa hotbed of danger and instability in the heart of Europe‚Äô. The territory, a peninsula almost the size of Belgium, jutting out into the Black Sea, had been part of Russia since 1783. It was transferred to Ukraine by Khrushchev in 1954, at a time when neither he nor anyone else imagined that the Soviet Union would ever break up.....When finally the referendum was held, in March 1994, it was ruled illegal by the Ukrainian Supreme Court. As a Russian commentator noted, two fundamental principles were in conflict: the right of peoples to self-determination and the inviolability of post-war frontiers.**"*
    - üìù *"**In the 1990s ‚Ä¶ the Russians were preoccupied with Ukraine,‚Äô one Western leader reflected, many years later. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think we sufficiently appreciated that at the time.‚Äô To Putin, Ukraine was a case study in the ingratitude of the former Soviet republics. ‚ÄòKiev owes us 4.5 billion US dollars for [subsidised Russian] energy supplies,‚Äô he complained in 1995. ‚ÄòAnd of course, they can‚Äôt pay ‚Ä¶ So why not, from tomorrow, sell [them] energy at world prices? But clearly no one wants that. They all want to get more and pay less. That‚Äôs how it is.‚Äô What Russia wanted, Putin said, was ‚Äòa sensible balance of interests‚Äô with the states of the Near Abroad, not some supposed ‚Äòequal partnership‚Äô. Russia did not need that. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve had those kinds of loud slogans for decades, and we‚Äôve swallowed enough of them ‚Ä¶ The [former] Soviet republics ‚Ä¶ were financed by Russia. Now what do we see there? Devastation, crises and wars ‚Ä¶ And what does Russia get out of it?'...The reference was to the frozen conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which had seceded from Georgia, and Transnistria in Moldova; the stand-off between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh; and the civil war in Tajikistan, where Putin had accompanied Sobchak on a fruitless mediation mission in October 1991. All had erupted during the final years of perestroika and, to Putin, all had their roots in the Bolsheviks‚Äô mistaken nationalities policy back in the 1920s, which had led to the Soviet Union becoming a mosaic of ethnically defined republics and districts.**."*
    - üìù *"**To Putin in the mid 1990s, from his vantage point in St Petersburg, Russian unity was the first priority. The Near Abroad came second. In third place were relations with the West. Like most Russians, Putin initially had mixed feelings about Western investment. The idea of Western companies owning historic buildings in the centre of St Petersburg made him uneasy, he said, until he realised that in many Western cities, prime real estate was owned by foreigners. Western aid, he thought, was acceptable in principle, but he worried that Russia would become a dumping ground for ‚Äòsecond-rate imports and outdated technology‚Äô, which would do nothing for the country‚Äôs development**....**Putin, too, remembered how everyone, not only in Russia but also in Eastern Europe, had imagined that the end of the Cold War would bring instant prosperity, but it had turned out to be a mirage**."*
    - üìù *"**What Russia needed most was not aid but ‚Äòa level playing field to work on‚Äô. Under those circumstances, foreign investment could play a positive role. ‚ÄòWe need foreign resources, Western experience, new ecological technology. We don‚Äôt need to be afraid of attracting large-scale Western capital. Business is egotistic by its very nature, but [we can] lay down strict legal limits**....**Putin had no illusions about Russia‚Äôs ability to sell its products abroad and he did not mince words about their poor quality. ‚ÄòWe must recognise honestly,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòthat we don‚Äôt have a single item of popular consumer goods that can compete on the world market. With us, everything is antediluvian, awful, ugly and unfashionable.‚Äô The only way to change that, he argued, was to open up the economy so that local manufacturers would be forced to compete with foreign imports. ‚ÄòOtherwise we will just go back to where we started years ago.‚Äô These views qualified Putin as an economic liberal...If he disagreed with Chubais and Gaidar over shock therapy, it was only because he felt it was asking too much of a population already in desperate straits**."*
    - üìù *"**However he was notably less enthusiastic when it came to political democracy. ‚ÄòPersonally,‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòI think that all political forces have the right to express their opinions‚Äô ‚Äì the word ‚Äòpersonally‚Äô suggesting that, rather than being a fundamental democratic principle, this was a matter on which other views were also legitimate. As for the division of powers between the executive and the legislature, this was necessary, he said, because it was ‚Äòthe most productive way‚Äô.**."*
    - üìù *"**To Putin, Russia was a great power and, even in its weakened state, it should be treated as such....because it reflected Putin‚Äôs obsession with respect ‚Äì for Russia, no less than for himself ‚Äì but of no lasting consequence. Much more important and much less easily finessed was his sense of Russia‚Äôs place in the world. Russia, he argued, should not be a buffer zone, ‚Äòa barrier between East and West, [but] first and foremost a connecting link between the two‚Äô. The role of the Near Abroad was fundamental. Russia‚Äôs influence there would remain dominant. Its neighbours in the post-Soviet space would serve as a go-between, linking Russia with Western Europe and Asia. The European Community was compatible with that vision: there was even talk in the early 1990s, both in Moscow and in some Western European capitals, of Russia eventually becoming a member.**."*
    - üìù *"**NATO was a different matter. It had started well. US Secretary of State James Baker had told Gorbachev in February 1990, in the context of German reunification, that ‚Äònot an inch of NATO‚Äôs present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction‚Äô. When Gorbachev doubled down and insisted that there should not be ‚Äòany extension of the zone of NATO‚Äô, Baker assured him that that would be the case. Although nothing was put in writing, from then on the State Department worked on the basis that there would be no eastward expansion of NATO and so did America‚Äôs allies. Helmut Kohl, Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher all reiterated Baker‚Äôs assurances at meetings with Soviet leaders. In March 1991, when the Soviet Defence Minister, Marshal Yazov, expressed his concern to Thatcher‚Äôs successor, John Major, about possible NATO enlargement, the British Prime Minister assured him that ‚Äònothing of the sort will happen‚Äô. Four months later, the NATO Secretary General, Manfred W√∂rner, told a Soviet delegation that he opposed NATO enlargement and so did most NATO members.**."*
    - üìù *"**The Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, took a different view. He and his Under Secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, believed that, regardless of perestroika, Moscow was still America‚Äôs main enemy and that Baker‚Äôs assurances had been unwarranted. On the issue of NATO enlargement, it was better ‚Äòto leave the door ajar'....‚Äúwere looking for every way to move [NATO‚Äôs borders] to the East, and we were constantly having to put out the fires they lit....President George H. W. Bush was ambivalent. On the one hand, he wanted to reassure Gorbachev that nothing would be done which might threaten Soviet security. On the other, he viewed NATO as a vital instrument for projecting US power and influence and he had no intention of giving it up.**."*
    - üìù *"**Until January 1993, when President Clinton took office, the State Department line prevailed. The message to Moscow was that NATO enlargement was not on the table. But by then, Bush‚Äôs insistence that the Atlantic alliance was a guarantor of stability, which had been strongly promoted by Wolfowitz, Paul Nitze and other Cold War hawks, had begun to make the East Europeans think again.**."*
    - üìù *"...**who warned that any short-term gains from admitting the Eastern and Central Europeans to NATO would be outweighed by the long-term damage it would do to the relationship with Russia**."*
    - üìù *"**President Clinton announced: ‚ÄòThe question is no longer whether NATO will take on new members, but when and how.‚Äô It took time for even some members of his own administration to realise that that was not just a way of kicking the can down the road but that Clinton‚Äôs mind was made up. Moscow was also at first unsure how seriously to take Clinton‚Äôs words. It was ‚Äòa hypothetical question‚Äô, Yeltsin told an interviewer, but if it happened, ‚Äòit would be seen as damaging to Russia‚Äô. Clinton had tried to sweeten the pill, announcing that he was creating a ‚ÄòPartnership for Peace‚Äô as a kind of halfway house leading to possible NATO membership. To avoid creating a new dividing line in Europe, he said, all the countries of the post-Soviet space, including Russia, would be welcome to join. Then, in September 1994, he promised Yeltsin that there would be no announcement of the names of the new members to be admitted to NATO, or of the timetable, until after the Russian presidential election two years later, to avoid providing ammunition to Yeltsin‚Äôs opponents.**."*
    - üìù *"...**That December, Yeltsin‚Äôs patience snapped...he warned that ‚Äòeven before the legacy of the Cold War has been laid to rest, Europe risks encumbering itself with a Cold Peace‚Äô. The Americans, who had convinced themselves that the Russians would meekly accept the changes Washington had decreed, were stunned. But it turned out to be a one-off. Clinton had judged correctly. Russia was too weak, and too embroiled in its own problems, to be able to put up any serious resistance.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"**The one fly in the ointment was James Baker‚Äôs promise to Gorbachev five years earlier that NATO would not move ‚Äòan inch‚Äô towards the East.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"**Eventually, a workaround was found. Baker‚Äôs assurance, American officials claimed, had referred only to the stationing of NATO troops in East Germany. The question of what would happen further east had never been raised. That was dishonest. Strobe Talbott, among others, has confirmed that Baker did indeed make an unconditional pledge that there would be no enlargement even if, in so doing, he may have gone beyond what President Bush intended. But, as a get-out, it was the best that anyone in the State Department could come up with and it has remained the American position ever since.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**George H. W. Bush, took the view that, as Bob Gates, his CIA Director, put it, ‚Äòif you don‚Äôt get it right with Russia and China, none of the rest matters‚Äô. Bush, Gates said, would have fobbed off the Eastern Europeans with half-measures and would not have allowed them to become full NATO members. Clinton took the opposite tack. Partly for domestic political reasons ‚Äì outflanking the Republican Party and gaining electoral support from immigrants from former Soviet-bloc countries ‚Äì but above all because he had concluded that America‚Äôs overriding interest was to lock Eastern and Central Europe firmly into the Western camp, Clinton put NATO enlargement first and Russia‚Äôs sensitivities second. Politically that seemed to make sense...But militarily, it made no sense at all.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"..**The Eastern European tail was wagging the American dog. There was no way that American security would be enhanced by taking on a commitment to defend the European states abutting Russia‚Äôs borders...'No one was going to pause and consider the wisdom of giving them an unconditional military guarantee, which ‚Ä¶ seemed to me lunacy.‚Äô It was a blank cheque that could never be honoured, and ‚Äòdishing out cheques that can‚Äôt be honoured is ‚Ä¶ destroying the credibility of NATO as a defensive organisation.'....it is necessary to ask whether any American President would risk a nuclear war with Russia in order to defend Latvia or Estonia. Even at the height of the Cold War, in the 1970s and early 1980s, France and Germany had doubts about America‚Äôs willingness to come to their defence in the event of a Soviet invasion if doing so would entail an all-out nuclear conflict. From a European standpoint, such fears were well founded. The United States did not enter World War I until 1917, when it was already clear that Germany was losing, and remained aloof from World War II until it had itself been attacked in December 1941. There was no reason to think that in a new conflict, America would behave any differently.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"**Enlargement was a symbolic decision. The Russians thought that, if push came to shove, NATO would abandon its new members rather than risk a world war. But to both sides the symbolism was important. The Eastern Europeans felt protected and the Russians felt the West viewed them as an enemy.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"..**In public, at least, Yeltsin did not raise the matter of Baker‚Äôs promise and the assurances which other Western leaders had given in the early 1990s, partly because he did not wish to base his case on commitments made to his old rival, Gorbachev, but also because accusing the United States of breaking its word would not make a solution any easier...Putin, following these events from the Mayor‚Äôs Office at Smolny, had no such qualms...'He railed against the West and against NATO for breaking its pledge. He was willing to accept European Community membership [for the Eastern and Central Europeans], but NATO was a step too far. We argued that if you have democratically elected governments ‚Ä¶ and they choose of their own accord to join NATO, you shouldn‚Äôt regard it as a hostile act. He wasn‚Äôt prepared to accept that at all.'**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"**Not all of Putin‚Äôs ideas about the world and the place which Russia should have in it were fashioned during the years he spent beside the Neva. But on the key issues ‚Äì NATO, relations with the West, the importance of the Near Abroad, Russia‚Äôs role as a bridge between Asia and Europe, and the need for strong, centralised government which would hold the country together ‚Äì the basic strands of his thinking were already clearly laid down.**."*
    - Chapter 8 - "Moscow Rules" - *"...As a consequence of Sobchak‚Äôs difficult relations with Yeltsin, Putin had gained a reputation in the Kremlin as the ‚Äògo-to‚Äô person in St Petersburg when problems had to be solved.."*
    - *"...Of them all, Putin found it hardest to get used to Moscow. His whole life had revolved around St Petersburg. After the move, he often went back at weekends to see his parents and spend time with friends.31 ‚ÄòI wouldn‚Äôt say that I didn‚Äôt like Moscow,‚Äô he said later. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just that I liked Petersburg more.'."*
    - *"...**'Putin possesses systematic thinking and penetrates quickly to the heart of the matter.‚Äô...‚Äòbehind-the-scenes problem-solving, phenomenal flair and extreme caution in making decisions‚Äô. ...‚Äòfrom the very beginning, he stood out among the deputies. He formulated issues brilliantly.‚Äô ....Putin stood out in another way, too. Before leaving St Petersburg, he had made it clear that, when he arrived in Moscow, he intended to be his own man. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hard for me to imagine what factions and cliques might exist there‚Äô, he said. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going to get involved in any of that. They are bringing me to work, and that is what I am going to do.‚Äô He tried to avoid becoming enmeshed in the intrigues which beset Yeltsin‚Äôs court and apparently he succeeded. Lyudmila: ‚ÄòHe is always trying to smooth out conflicts, and he manages to do it, even when I think he is wrong to try. He doesn‚Äôt have any enemies, which is very unusual in Russia.‚Äô...Putin showed himself determined in pursuing budgetary abuses and unafraid to offend powerful interests.**..."*
    - *"....**The next six months were the most intensive period of economic reform of Yeltsin‚Äôs presidency. State expenditures were cut by 20 per cent. Tax collection was sharply increased. Even the state-owned behemoths were unable to escape. The gas monopoly, Gazprom, alone paid 2.4 billion US dollars in back taxes. Almost 2,000 state enterprises were privatised, bringing the treasury another 2.4 billion dollars. Insider auctions were banned and, for the first time, foreign companies were allowed to take part....To the oligarchs, as the leading business magnates were now called, that was going too far. Nine months earlier, Boris Berezovsky had told the Financial Times that he and six other businessmen, who would be dubbed the semibankirshchina, the seven bankers ‚Äì a play on words on the semiboyarshchina, the seven boyars who ruled Russia after the overthrow of the Tsar in 1610 ‚Äì effectively controlled the financial and political power of the state. The time had come for him to prove that that was indeed the case**...."*
    - *"...**'The stakes were extremely high for Putin. It was at this point that the people in the Kremlin started noticing him ‚Ä¶ There were a lot of windbags around, who were incapable of carrying out an actual project. And here was Putin ‚Äì look at the logistics of what he did! He didn‚Äôt just declare his loyalty, he did [it] and he succeeded. It was a success ‚Ä¶ And to be honest, success was pretty rare in the Kremlin then.'**..."*
    - *"...**Yet it is difficult to believe that he would willingly have given up a career in public service to move to the private sector when his name was constantly being mentioned in the press as a man destined for higher things. He was a gosudarstvennik, a statist, through and through. He might occasionally wonder aloud about life as a lawyer or a businessman, but in reality, as he said himself, entrepreneurship was ‚Äònot [his] thing at all‚Äô. The griping about being bored was a front. He preferred public service and would leave only if he had no choice.**.."*
    - *"...**The main priority, however, on which both Kiriyenko and Yeltsin had insisted when he was appointed, was economic security. This covered privatisation and relations with the oligarchs; control of financial flows through private and state-owned banks; and the repatriation of illegally exported capital. The reason soon became clear. Russia was on the verge of financial meltdown. It stemmed from the Asian financial crisis a year earlier, which had led to a sharp fall in the price of oil and gas and non-ferrous metals, then, as now, Russia‚Äôs biggest exports. The situation had been made worse by the government‚Äôs insistence on maintaining the exchange rate of the rouble, which quickly drained the country‚Äôs foreign reserves. In July, the IMF and the World Bank agreed a 22.6-billion-dollar rescue package, designed to support the Russian currency by converting high-interest short-term loans into longer-term Eurobonds. But far from being reassured, money managers took fright. On August 17, 1998, Russia defaulted on domestic debt, announced a moratorium on foreign debt repayments and abandoned the floating peg for the rouble, which over the following month lost two thirds of its dollar value.**."*
    - *"...**A solid, well-respected, avuncular character, he quickly won parliamentary approval and over the next eight months showed himself to be the reassuring figure that Russia needed. The devalued rouble, by making imports more expensive, sparked a recovery in domestic manufactures, oil prices rose and sovereign debt was restructured. By the end of the year, instead of collapsing as many had feared, the economy was beginning to rebound. ‚ÄòPrimakov ‚Ä¶ had a confident ease about him that was able to quell and subdue the almost panic-stricken people in September and October,‚Äô Yeltsin wrote later. ‚Äò[He] achieved the kind of stable position that no other Russian Prime Minister had been able to achieve before.‚Äô**."*
    - *"...Soon after becoming FSB Director, Putin was confronted with a scandal involving Chubais‚Äôs nemesis, Boris Berezovsky....had given them secret orders to assassinate Berezovsky and several other prominent figures. The story was not implausible. It was an open secret that certain senior FSB officers were in the pay of mafia figures....After Putin‚Äôs appointment, Berezovsky took the group‚Äôs leader, Aleksandr Litvinenko, to meet him at his office in the Lubyanka and make a full report. Putin heard him out, but the meeting did not go well. He had shown no interest, Litvinenko told his wife afterwards. ‚ÄòHe was cold and formal.‚Äô It could hardly have been otherwise. Putin despised FSB officers who made their grievances public. But Litvinenko was wrong to think that the new director did not take his complaints seriously. **Putin usually heard out his interlocutors in silence ‚Äì as did Yeltsin ‚Äì and decided only later how to respond.**....Shortly afterwards Litvinenko was dismissed from the FSB and arrested. It was the start of a long journey which would eventually lead him to an agonising death in London. Putin had had reservations about Berezovsky ever since their first encounters in St Petersburg. Lyudmila told friends that they regarded the oligarch as ‚ÄòEnemy Number One'....'He‚Äôs the worst criminal you can think of,‚Äô Putin told him. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs going to damage Russia and he will damage your country, too.'."*
    - *"...**Birthdays in Russia have an importance of which it is difficult for Westerners to conceive.** To attend a birthday party for Berezovsky‚Äôs wife at a time when the oligarch was at his most vulnerable would earn his undying support. The ruse succeeded. **Berezovsky was convinced from then on that Putin was a true and loyal friend, and he continued to think so long afterwards, even after they had fallen out.**."*
    - *"...The Skuratov affair damaged Primakov, not because he supported the Prosecutor General openly but because Yeltsin suspected complicity between them....The Prime Minister was an intelligent, thoughtful man, but he was also, in the President‚Äôs view, an old-school apparatchik, a ‚Äòreal dinosaur ‚Ä¶ hostage to Soviet stereotypes‚Äô,133 as had been shown by his reaction ‚Äì or the lack of it ‚Äì when a wave of anti-Semitism, whipped up by ultra-nationalist members of Zhirinovsky‚Äôs party in the Duma, had swept over Russia the previous winter....By mid April, 1999, the President had decided that Primakov would have to go."*
    - üìù *"...the Duma, which had been threatening for almost a year to impeach Yeltsin, was finally preparing to put the issue to a vote. **Yeltsin was accused on five counts: responsibility for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; using armed force to disperse the Congress of People‚Äôs Deputies during the White House siege in 1993; launching an illegal war in Chechnya; weakening Russian military power by ill-considered budget cuts; and genocide against the peoples of Russia through economic reforms which had caused demographic decline.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**three days before the Duma was due to vote, the President dismissed Primakov and nominated Stepashin to take his place. Should the impeachment succeed, it would mean that Stepashin rather than Primakov would become acting President pending fresh elections. Yeltsin recognised that it might make the opposition close ranks against him, but he discounted that. ‚ÄòA sharp, unexpected, aggressive move always throws your opponent off balance,‚Äô he explained, ‚Äòespecially if it is unpredictable and seems absolutely illogical.‚Äô It was a lesson from a master tactician which Putin would take to heart.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"**Ever since the 1996 presidential election, Yeltsin had been preoccupied, if not obsessed, with how to safeguard his legacy...The main challenge of his second term would be to find a suitable successor. Yeltsin had initially seen Boris Nemtsov as a possible candidate. During his first term, he had visited Nizhny Novgorod, where Nemtsov was Governor, and had been impressed by his energy...But after persuading him to come to Moscow in the spring of 1997, Yeltsin had been disappointed. Nemtsov, he decided, was like Chubais ‚Äì ‚Äòa technologist, a manager, a specialist, [not] a national figure capable of consolidating whole segments of society‚Äô. Chernomyrdin and Primakov were of another generation, reticent about reform and incapable of leading Russia in the new century that was about to dawn. Kiriyenko‚Äôs government had been ‚Äòmanagerial, technocratic ‚Ä¶ and had no political backing ‚Äì no credibility and no influence over the public‚Äô. Yeltsin had considered others, too, but had quickly ruled them out. The leader of Yabloko, Grigory Yavlinsky, was ‚Äòa good, strong figure‚Äô but sectarian and too much obliged to his own political faction. Igor Ivanov, the Foreign Minister, was an ally of Primakov.**"*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"**That left Vladimir Putin. Yeltsin had begun thinking of Putin as a possible Prime Minister in the summer of 1998, when it had become clear that Kiriyenko was not up to the task. He had thought hard about Putin‚Äôs role in Sobchak‚Äôs departure. ‚ÄòI had mixed feelings [about it],‚Äô he wrote later. ‚ÄòYet I profoundly admired his actions.‚Äô Yumashev was convinced that that episode, more than any other, persuaded Yeltsin that Putin had the stuff to become President. He had already been effectively in charge of Russia‚Äôs second city, St Petersburg. After he was given responsibility for the regions, he impressed Yeltsin by the tough, no-nonsense approach he took towards the governors. As FSB chief, he had refused to kowtow to Primakov. He did not ‚Äòallow himself to be manipulated in political games‚Äô, Yeltsin wrote, and his ‚Äòvery tough remarks condemning political extremism‚Äô had prevented troubles spilling over into the streets after the government‚Äôs tepid response to Makashov‚Äôs anti-Semitic speeches.**"*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"**Yeltsin: 'Putin ‚Ä¶ had the will and the resolve. I knew he did. But intuition told me that it would be premature to bring Putin into the political ring at that moment [in May, 1999]. He had to appear later ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want the public to get too used to Putin in those lazy summer months ‚Ä¶ The surprise factor had to remain intact ‚Ä¶ I needed someone to serve as a decoy. There was no alternative. This role had to be entrusted to the nice, decent Sergei Stepashin. Of course, I would try to explain to him that the question of the future, of the presidential elections, was still open. And he, too, would have a chance to show himself.'**....**But those lines were written a year later, when the drama had already played out. At the time, it was not as clear-cut. Yeltsin felt that Putin would make a strong candidate. But that did not mean that he had taken a final decision.....When Stepashin was appointed, the intention was still to hold the presidential elections as planned in June 2000. He had a full year to prove himself. Had he done so, Yeltsin might have made Stepashin, rather than Putin, his preferred successor.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**There was another consideration, too. Yeltsin had won re-election in 1996 thanks to the support of the oligarchs. They had now become too powerful...Berezovsky, in particular, was a thorn in Yeltsin‚Äôs side. He was ‚Äòsick and tired of even the mention of Berezovsky‚Äôs name‚Äô, he wrote. ‚ÄòBut I always tried to keep him on my team ‚Ä¶ We are at times compelled to use people for whom we don‚Äôt have particularly warm feelings. [He] was unquestionably an ally. But he was a difficult ally.'**....**The only group in Russia capable of cutting the oligarchs down to size were the siloviki, the men ‚Äì and, in Russia, they were all men ‚Äì in senior posts in the ‚Äòpower ministries'...Yeltsin framed the recourse to the siloviki not as an attempt to curb the oligarchs but as a response to a changing mood in society. In fact, the two were linked. ‚ÄòFor some time,‚Äô Yeltsin wrote, ‚ÄòI had been sensing the need for a new quality in the state, for a steel backbone that would strengthen the whole government. We needed a person who was intellectual, democratic, [but also] firm in the military manner.'...Putin, Yeltsin thought, answered that description.**"*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**For the Yeltsin administration, the key issues remained what they had been in Soviet times: relations with the United States and the role of NATO. When Putin had arrived in Moscow in the autumn of 1996, it was already clear that NATO was determined to take in new members from Eastern and Central Europe, but as yet there had been no public announcement. The following March, Yeltsin met President Clinton in Helsinki and warned again that enlargement risked leading to renewed East‚ÄìWest confrontation. The Americans responded by offering to make Russia a full member of the Group of Seven, which would then become the G8. Other cosmetic gestures followed and in May 1997, Yeltsin travelled to Paris to sign what was known as ‚ÄòThe Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation‚Äô, setting up a formal structure for consultations. But it was acquiescence in the face of force majeure, and when, in July, NATO officially extended membership invitations to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, Russian opposition was undimmed.**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Putin at that time echoed the official Russian position that NATO posed ‚Äòno direct strategic threat to Russia‚Äô. But he added that the government should seize the opportunity to modernise the armed forces, focusing in particular on research and development.161 The implication was that he did not think NATO would necessarily remain non-threatening for ever.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**In March 1999, when he took charge of the Security Council, the situation evolved further. That month, the three former Warsaw Pact states became NATO members, bringing the American-led alliance to the border, if not of the Russian mainland, at least of the enclave of Kaliningrad. At the same time, the war in Yugoslavia, that had seemed on the way to resolution with the signing of the Dayton accords which ended the conflict in Bosnia, suddenly entered a more dangerous phase. Kosovo, a semi-autonomous region of southern Serbia, bordering Albania and with a majority Albanian population, became the new flashpoint. Armed clashes had broken out the previous year between the Serbian army and Kosovar insurgents demanding independence. Both sides committed atrocities but the Serbs engaged in systematic rape and pillage. Western sympathies were with the Kosovars, of whom a quarter of a million, nearly a sixth of the population, had fled their homes to escape the depredations of the Serbian soldiery. Peace talks at Rambouillet, outside Paris, broke down on March 18 when the Russians and Yugoslavs rejected a proposal to send in a NATO peacekeeping contingent. Six days later, without UN authorisation, NATO forces began airstrikes against Serbian army positions, including targets in Belgrade and other Yugoslav cities, to try to force the Serbian troops to withdraw.**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Up till then, Yeltsin had offered cautious support to the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, but had avoided doing anything which might cause Russia to be dragged into the conflict. The United States had been equally wary. The bombing raids changed that. To Russians, the Serbs were fellow Slavs who, all through history, had been their allies. Moscow was outraged at what was seen as Western aggression, all the more humiliating because it was powerless to intervene.**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Two and a half months later, Yeltsin succeeded in brokering a compromise. The airstrikes would be suspended; Serbian forces would withdraw; and a 30,000-man peacekeeping force of NATO and Russian troops would be deployed to Kosovo under UN auspices. But the most dangerous moment was still to come. The Russian General Staff was incensed that the Americans seemed to be taking Moscow‚Äôs cooperation for granted. Instead of waiting to start moving in simultaneously with NATO forces on the morning of June 12, as had been agreed, they had despatched a column of 30 armoured vehicles the previous evening to secure the country‚Äôs one airport, outside the capital, Pri≈°tina. When the NATO contingent arrived, it found the airport already in Russian hands...Putin had authorised the Russian operation**..."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**His account is plausible. General Mike Jackson, the British Commander of the NATO force, wrote afterwards: ‚Äò[It] was a reminder that the Russians were still players on the world stage, that they still needed to be treated with respect.‚Äô Those were precisely Putin‚Äôs feelings. It was the kind of gesture that both he and Yeltsin favoured ‚Äì an unpredictable move which would take the adversary by surprise ‚Äì but hedged with a certain caution. Putin had made clear to Kvashnin that it was up to him to take the final decision. Gleb Pavlovsky, who worked with Putin for 12 years, saw that as one of the hallmarks of his style of governance. As a general rule, Pavlovsky said, ‚Äòhe doesn‚Äôt like to answer in a definite way ‚Ä¶ He can give an emotional impression; he can show the direction. But not be definite. That way, his own responsibility is not engaged. It‚Äôs your fault for understanding it like that.'.**..."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**It was the first time he had met Putin. Talbott was struck by ‚Äòhis ability to convey self-control and confidence in a low-key, soft-spoken manner. He ‚Ä¶radiated executive competence, the ability to get things done.‚Äô There were no histrionics or bombast, but rather ‚Äòa menacing, or at least, a commanding, undertone; softness with a hard edge'**..."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**The critical point came the following day, when the American Supreme Commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, ordered the runways at Pri≈°tina blocked to prevent the Russians resupplying their soldiers, raising the prospect of a direct clash between Russian and NATO forces. ‚ÄòSir, I‚Äôm not going to start World War III for you,‚Äô Jackson famously replied. Clark backed off and a compromise was eventually found: the Russians would play a supporting role in Kosovo, much as they had in Bosnia under the Dayton accords. When Putin next saw Talbott, he explained glibly that there were hawks and doves in Russia, as in the United States, and that the hawks had been behind the pre-emptive sprint to Pri≈°tina. But there had been no loss of life and at least no one could now call Yeltsin a NATO puppet.**..."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Clinton said afterwards that he had never believed that Kosovo would trigger a full-scale nuclear showdown because, unlike Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, Yeltsin had not been testing American resolve. Nonetheless, for 24 hours, the Cuban crisis had been on everyone‚Äôs minds. Although the circumstances this time were very different, there was a similar sense that a line had been crossed. Clinton had felt it during a telephone call to Yeltsin the day the airstrikes began. ‚ÄòSomething pretty basic is broken, and it will take a lot of fixing', he told Talbott afterwards....It would be wrong to focus on NATO enlargement and the Kosovo affair as the origin of all America‚Äôs subsequent problems with Russia. But the combination was devastating.**..."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**As Moscow saw it, less than three weeks after NATO had admitted its first Eastern European members, it had begun bombarding Serbia, a traditional Russian ally. It was the first sustained combat operation the alliance had conducted since its founding, 50 years before, and it had been undertaken without UN authorisation and in disregard of Yeltsin‚Äôs entreaties to find a diplomatic solution. Without the bombing raids, Milo≈°eviƒá would no doubt have bludgeoned the Kosovars into submission. But under international law, Kosovo was part of Serbia. To Russia, NATO‚Äôs intervention was a crude attempt to modify a post-war European border by armed force. At a time when Russia itself was facing a separatist rebellion in the Caucasus, Yeltsin‚Äôs government felt particularly vulnerable. The Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, told his American counterpart, Madeleine Albright: ‚ÄòMadeleine, don‚Äôt you understand, we have many Kosovos in Russia.'.**..."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Yet the real problem, as Talbott wrote, was that, ‚Äòfrom the Russian standpoint ‚Ä¶ the US was acting as though it had the right to impose its view on the world‚Äô. Many Russians thought that the US had been acting that way since the end of the Second World War. Kosovo brought the point home.**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Yeltsin had still not decided at that point exactly when to announce Putin‚Äôs nomination. But events forced his hand. The situation in Chechnya had been steadily deteriorating. The Chechen President, Aslan Maskhadov, had lost control of the local warlords, the ‚Äòfield commanders‚Äô, as they were known, who demanded the installation of an Islamic Republic under sharia law. Order had broken down completely. The only gainful activities were the embezzlement of government funds, kidnapping for ransom and dealing in narcotics. In March 1999, Stepashin‚Äôs representative in Chechnya, General Gennady Shpigun, had been seized by insurgents at Grozny airport. When the government refused to pay 15 million US dollars for his release, he was killed. Two weeks after his abduction, the market at Vladikavkaz, in neighbouring North Ossetia, was blown up by Chechen terrorists, leaving dozens dead.**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**That spring, contingency plans were drawn up for the Russian army to occupy the northern third of Chechnya, as far as the Terek River, 15 miles north of the Chechen capital, Grozny. Yeltsin hesitated. The experience of the First Chechen War was not one he wished to repeat. But at the end of ‚ÄúJuly, he found himself with little choice. Two villages just over the border in neighbouring Dagestan, which had embraced the radical Wahhabi strain of Islam, announced the establishment of a shura, or consultative assembly, independent of the local authorities. When Interior Ministry troops were sent in to restore order, the villagers fought back. 1,400 armed militants, led by Shamil Basayev, the most feared of the Chechen field commanders, gathered at the border, preparing to come to their aid. Basayev may have been tricked into entering Dagestan in order to justify what followed. The Russian General Staff was itching for revenge after its humiliation in the first Chechen War. But whether contrived or not, the resumption of hostilities meant that Yeltsin could no longer delay.**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**'I‚Äôve made a decision ‚Ä¶ I would like to offer you the post of Prime Minister,‚Äô I told Putin ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI will work wherever you assign me,‚Äô [he] replied with military terseness. ‚ÄòAnd in the very highest post?‚Äô Putin hesitated. I sensed that for the first time, he truly realized what the conversation was about. ‚ÄòI had not thought about that. I don‚Äôt know if I am prepared for that,‚Äô said Putin. ‚ÄòThink about it. I have faith in you,‚Äô I said.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Next morning, Yeltsin received Putin, Voloshin and Stepashin at his home at Gorki-9.185 The Prime Minister was agitated. He shook hands with the President, but not with any of the others, and when Yeltsin asked him to countersign the decree appointing Putin first deputy Prime Minister, a necessary formality for the transfer of powers, he became flustered and objected. Aksyonenko, the other first deputy, whom Yeltsin had asked to be present so that he could sign in Stepashin‚Äôs place if the Prime Minister refused, started to remonstrate with him. Putin stopped him. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hard enough for Stepashin,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs not make it worse.‚Äô Stepashin signed. Shortly afterwards, announcing his departure on television, he described Putin as ‚Äòa decent and worthy man‚Äô, but added, unable to hide his bitterness: ‚ÄòI wish him good luck, really good luck, because he has everything else.'.**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**From the start, Putin struck a different tone from his predecessors. Yeltsin had given him a mandate to be tough and it seemed to fit him like a glove. In his first television interview, a few hours after his appointment, he was asked what he would do if strikers decided to ‚Äògo out and sit on the railway tracks‚Äô, as the miners had done during the summer. ‚ÄòIf they sit?‚Äô, he asked, and then answered his own question: ‚ÄòThey‚Äôll sit in the slammer. Anyone who destabilises the situation will be put away.‚Äô That was not how government ministers usually talked. Asked how he felt, he replied: ‚Äòcombative‚Äô.**..."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Putin ordered airstrikes against the bases of the militants in Chechnya and pay rises for troops fighting in the Caucasus. It was announced that the Chief of the General Staff, General Kvashnin, would in future report to him, not to Yeltsin. So would Nikolai Patrushev, who had succeeded him at the FSB. ‚ÄòWe are dealing with international terrorist gangs,‚Äô Putin warned. ‚ÄòThe abscess will remain, [until] our relations with Chechnya are settled.‚Äô
    The following day, August 16, he was confirmed as Prime Minister by the Duma by a narrow but sufficient margin, as Yumashev had predicted. Two weeks later, it was announced that the first phase of the campaign in Dagestan had been completed. Basayev‚Äôs forces had been driven out. The fighting had caused massive destruction of civilian life and property. Nonetheless, it was hailed as a victory. ‚ÄòPutin has won his first battle,‚Äô wrote the newspaper, Kommersant. ‚ÄòHis debut was successful.‚Äô It turned out to be just the prologue.**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**...On September 4, a block of flats in Buinaksk housing border guards and their families was blown up, killing 58 people and injuring a hundred others. It was the first of the so-called apartment bombings which, in the next two weeks, would claim more than 300 lives. Putin had told the troops during a visit to Dagestan a few days earlier: ‚ÄòWe have no right to allow ourselves to be weak.‚Äô After the Buinaksk explosion, he ordered the three villages razed.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Five days later, a second explosion occurred, killing 106 people in Moscow. At first it was thought to have been caused by a gas leak. But on the morning of September 10, it was officially confirmed that it was a terrorist attack. Putin was due to leave that day for a summit meeting of APEC, the Asia‚ÄìPacific Economic Cooperation forum, in Auckland, New Zealand, almost 24 hours‚Äô flying time from Moscow. With Yeltsin‚Äôs agreement, he decided that the visit should go ahead. The day after he arrived, he told President Clinton that the apartment bombings were linked to the situation in Dagestan and that he had ‚Äòevery reason to believe‚Äô that the perpetrators were from the movement led by Osama bin Laden which had also been attacking US targets. Clinton let the reference to al-Qaeda pass but assured him that ‚Äòso long as you use appropriate means to fight terrorists and separatists, the United States will stand by you.‚Äô As would become clear over the next year, when allegations flew back and forth about the excesses of the Russian military, the word ‚Äòappropriate‚Äô was an important qualification. Yeltsin had originally planned to attend the Auckland summit himself, but a few days earlier had called Clinton to tell him that Putin would go instead, adding, almost as an afterthought, that he would be ‚Äòthe next Russian President in the year 2000‚Äô**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**The officials listening in at the White House were ‚Äòblindsided‚Äô, one of them said later. When Yeltsin had announced Putin‚Äôs appointment, he had described him as ‚Äòa person who is able ‚Ä¶ to consolidate society and ‚Ä¶ ensure the continuation of reforms in Russia‚Äô. But he had not said directly that Putin was the heir apparent. Many in Washington had assumed that he would be just another in the seemingly endless series of prime ministers whom Yeltsin tried out for a few months and then discarded. It gave his meeting with Clinton in New Zealand an entirely different significance. The two men spent more than an hour together. The transcript shows them both probing, trying to get the measure of each other without giving much away.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**..Nonetheless, the US President came away feeling that the new Russian Prime Minister was ‚Äòvery smart and thoughtful‚Äô and had ‚Äòenormous potential‚Äô. He appeared flexible on Strategic Arms Reduction, genuinely concerned about nuclear proliferation and the risk of nuclear terrorism, and willing to discuss export limits to Iran so long as there was a level playing field for Russian companies dealing with Tehran. However, it was when the conversation turned to election strategy, a subject close to Clinton‚Äôs heart, that the President got the clearest sense of where his interlocutor was coming from. Some of Yeltsin‚Äôs actions domestically, Putin told Clinton, might seem hard to understand, but they made sense in a Russian context. Americans needed to remember that ‚ÄòRussia does not have an established political system. People don‚Äôt read [party] programmes. They look at the faces of the leaders, regardless of party affiliation ‚Ä¶ Most of the population thinks like that. They are not very sophisticated. That‚Äôs the reality we have to deal with.‚Äô Elections were much on Putin‚Äôs mind because he would face two in quick succession in the coming months: first, the Duma elections in December and then the presidential election which was to take place the following summer. He had never liked elections ‚Äì an aversion aggravated by his experience with Sobchak in St Petersburg ‚Äì and did not try to hide it. Yeltsin had reassured him: ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt have to run the campaign. The main thing is your will, your confidence, your actions. Everything will depend on that.‚Äô So it turned out. For the Duma elections, Gleb Pavlovsky worked on strategy ‚Äì a subject in which, he said, Putin showed no interest whatever. They had had a meeting with Voloshin at the end of August, at which Pavlovsky had given a brief explanation of the concept for the campaign. ‚ÄòI finished my presentation,‚Äô he remembered, ‚Äòand Putin was silent. He said nothing. So Voloshin asked him: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? Are you against it?‚Äù And Putin said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not against it.‚Äù That was all he said. And that‚Äôs how we started the campaign.'**.."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Meanwhile Putin cultivated the image of a tough, determined, young leader, valiantly defending the Russian people against cowardly terrorist attacks. After another explosion in Moscow on September 13, which killed 119 people, he denounced those responsible as ‚Äòrabid beasts‚Äô. Chechnya had become ‚Äòan enormous terrorist camp‚Äô, he warned, where banditry was the normal way of life.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**For the first few days after the apartment bombings, there was a mood of utter prostration. No one knew what to do ‚Ä¶ Then Putin said to us. ‚ÄòYou do as you like. I am going to fight. If I lose, I lose. But I am going to make war ‚Ä¶‚Äô I remember the day when he took that position ‚Äì he simply felt that this was his moment and this was what he had to do ‚Ä¶ We had hoped that he would distance himself from all that. Because, without exception, all the politicians who have taken on Chechen wars have bitten the dust. It‚Äôs a cemetery, a political graveyard. No one comes out of a Chechen war looking good.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**The Khasavyurt agreement, which Yeltsin had signed to end the first Chechen war, had been a mistake, he said...After Khasavyurt, the Chechens had created a criminal economy in their republic...No Prime Minister before had criticised Yeltsin so bluntly. None had spelt out so defiantly the need to resist. But Putin felt it necessary to distance himself from the President and make clear that he was his own man**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**After the airport at Grozny was bombed, Putin was asked by a reporter what areas were being targeted. ‚ÄòWherever the bandits are,‚Äô he replied. ‚ÄòIf they are at an airport, we‚Äôll hit them at the airport.‚Äô Next day, asked the same question again, he came out with a one-liner which would stay with him for the rest of his career: ‚ÄòIf ‚Äúwe catch them in the shithouse, we‚Äôll wipe them out in the shithouse.‚Äô Western Russia experts argued for months whether the outburst had been planned by Putin‚Äôs spin doctors to strike public opinion or whether it had come naturally. His colleagues knew better. It was the language of the streets, which would erupt spontaneously when Putin felt provoked...who had known Putin earlier in St Petersburg, his ‚Äòvery distinctive style, a very unusual, literary way of speaking‚Äô, totally unlike Yeltsin or any of the Soviet leaders. Yet he could also be crude and vulgar.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Putin tried to reassure Russians that there would be no repetition of what he called the ‚Äòill-fated Chechen campaign‚Äô of the mid 1990s. Any operations would be carried out in ‚Äòa very measured and careful way‚Äô. There would be ‚Äòno frontal assaults. We will patiently and methodically destroy them from the air.‚Äô As late as September 28, he insisted that ‚Äòwe are not talking about a ground operation‚Äô. Two days later, Russian ground forces crossed the border.....Putin then promised ‚Äòno tank attacks or raids on towns‚Äô and ‚Äòno extreme measures like carpet bombing‚Äô, in order to minimise civilian casualties. Soon afterwards, tank attacks and carpet bombing began.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**The first of many barbaric attacks to make headlines in the West was a missile strike on Grozny on October 21, in which at least 140 people, including many women and children, died when the city‚Äôs market, a mosque and a maternity hospital were hit. Putin, who had just arrived in Helsinki for an EU‚ÄìRussia summit, denied that Russian forces were responsible and surmised that it might have been the result of ‚Äòa firefight between rival bandit groups‚Äô. That was a bare-faced lie. The missile strikes were part of a systematic campaign to terrorise the civilian population and show that resistance was useless...Putin‚Äôs assurances that ‚Äòwe are not putting an equals sign between the bandits and the Chechen people‚Äô convinced no one.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**The Russian military were incapable of waging a sophisticated counter-insurgency campaign. They understood only violence. But they were the only army Putin had. On the Chechen side, Maskhadov‚Äôs government was no better. Its writ did not run outside Grozny. Elsewhere, local warlords held sway. Chechnya was a failed state, not much different from Somalia except that it was part of Russia. Putin was well aware that in the end there would have to be a political solution, but for that to happen he had to have a partner to negotiate with. In the winter of 1999, there was none...To Putin, the brutality of the war was the price to be paid to prevent still worse tragedies, and those who refused to see that were hypocrites.**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**CLINTON:'It‚Äôs important to protect your sovereignty and territorial integrity and to stand against terrorism. But if the price is to incur major civilian casualties, that‚Äôs too high a price to pay ‚Ä¶ You need to combine a political with a military strategy ‚Ä¶PUTIN: I think you will agree with me that it is not in the United States‚Äô interest to have an extremist state between the Black Sea and the Caspian ‚Ä¶ The question is how we crush this base of terrorism but take minimal losses. What will be done will be done ‚Ä¶ How can we negotiate with terrorists?'**"*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**..remembered that, throughout the meeting, Putin pushed back hard. It was very different from their first, rather tentative encounter in Auckland. On other contentious issues ‚Äì the presence of Russian troops in Georgia and Transnistria, and the revised treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe which was to be signed in Istanbul later that month ‚Äì Putin did not give an inch. That was partly because he found Clinton‚Äôs arguments on Chechnya unconvincing and partly because, as the US President acknowledged, the conflict was ‚Äòplaying well for [Putin] at home‚Äô. The newspaper, Izvestia, wrote that week: ‚ÄòHis tough stance on Chechnya has endeared him to virtually all Russians ‚Ä¶ The more the West pressures [him], the more attractive he appears to Russian voters.'**."*

    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**As he had told Clinton, most Russians voted for a personality, not a programme. Many people, particularly in the provinces, found Putin more attractive than Primakov, a nomenklatura apparatchik, or Luzhkov, who was popular in Moscow but not outside the capital. Five days prior to election day, Yeltsin had summoned Putin to Gorki-9, where he told him that he intended to resign and make him acting President. Putin was taken aback. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not ready for that decision,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòYou see, it‚Äôs a rather difficult destiny ‚Ä¶ Maybe it would be better if you left at the end of your term.‚Äô But Yeltsin‚Äôs mind was made up. Instead of waiting until June 2000, it would be better to resign now, take his opponents by surprise and give Russia a new President for the new millennium. ‚ÄòYou haven‚Äôt answered,‚Äô he pressed Putin. ‚ÄòI agree,‚Äô the Prime Minister replied. He did not really have a choice. As he put it: ‚ÄòMy fate was allowing me to work at the highest level ‚Ä¶ It would be stupid to say, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôd rather sell sunflower seeds,‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm going into private law practice ‚Ä¶‚Äù So I decided to do it.‚Äù**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Ominous comparisons were drawn between Putin‚Äôs invasion of Chechnya and Milo≈°eviƒá‚Äôs attempts to subdue the rebellious Kosovars, which had prompted NATO intervention. Although the Russians angrily denied it, there was an obvious parallel. But it was one thing for the West to go to war against a small Balkan state like Serbia, quite another to risk war with Russia, a nuclear-armed former superpower which, if it were to begin to disintegrate, would pose unimaginable security concerns. In practice, Western governments went no further than verbal condemnation. Putin was unmoved. ‚ÄòRussia has the right to defend itself,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòIf we don‚Äôt complete this operation, everything will start all over again.'**.*"
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**For Yeltsin, it was an emotional farewell. Speaking slowly, a few words at a time, his face like a leather mask, he apologised for all that he had failed to do and said that Russia needed ‚Äònew politicians, new faces, new, strong, intelligent and energetic people‚Äô: 'We, who have been in power for many years, must go ‚Ä¶ Many of our hopes were not realised. What we thought was easy has proved painfully difficult. I would like to ask forgiveness from those of you who hoped that we would be able to make a leap in just one go from the grey, stagnant totalitarian past to a bright, prosperous and civilised future. I myself believed in this. But it was not possible ‚Ä¶ In some respects, I was na√Øve ‚Ä¶ I did everything I could.' .... ‚Äì he turned to Putin, who was standing beside him, looking small and rather awkward, as if daunted by the burden that had fallen on his shoulders, and said quietly: ‚ÄòTake care of Russia!‚Äô**."*

Communism, he said, had been ‚Äòa blind alley, far away from the mainstream of civilisation‚Äô, which had doomed Russia to lag behind the advanced countries. 'Russia‚Äôs GNP is ten times smaller than the US and five times smaller than China ‚Ä¶ Labour productivity and real wages are extremely low ‚Ä¶ Over 70 per cent of our machinery and equipment is over ten years old ‚Ä¶ Only five per cent of Russian enterprises are engaged in innovative production.

For the first time, he criticised the West directly for its refusal to understand what was at stake in the Caucasus. ‚ÄòNot only are we disappointed with the Western position,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòbut we consider that it is in the national interest of the Western countries to support Russia in its struggle with international terrorism.‚Äô...Only two weeks earlier, Putin had said that if Western leaders did not understand the situation in Chechnya, it was ‚Äòclearly our own fault‚Äô for not having explained it well enough.

But it was true that, in most of Chechnya, large-scale clashes had ended and, for the first time, Putin started speaking of the possibility of peace talks...The only Chechen leader in whom Putin had even minimal confidence was the Chief Mufti, Akhmad Kadyrov. He had been born in Kazakhstan, where Stalin had exiled the Chechens during World War II. After restrictions on religious freedom were relaxed under Gorbachev, he had studied at a madrasa in Bukhara and afterwards in Tashkent and Amman, returning to Chechnya in 1991 when its then leader, Dzhokhar Dudayev, declared independence...‚ÄúAs Chief Mufti, he had proclaimed a jihad against Russia and fought in the first Chechen War alongside Shamil Basayev. But under Dudayev‚Äôs successor, Maskhadov, he had become increasingly concerned by the inroads of Wahhabism and the internationalisation of the conflict and had spoken out publicly against Basayev‚Äôs expedition to Dagestan and the insurgency that followed....After their first meeting, Putin had described Kadyrov as ‚Äònot a very easy partner‚Äô but a man who deserved respect. But to commit to any Chechen leader was a gamble and Putin proceeded cautiously. That spring he declared direct presidential rule in Chechnya and appointed Kadyrov head of administration. It was made clear that it was an interim position. There would be no final decision on the territory‚Äôs future for another two years.**.."*

The ill-feeling generated by Kosovo and NATO‚Äôs bombing campaign in Yugoslavia had not dissipated. NATO enlargement remained a running sore and the Americans seemed determined to develop a National Missile Defense system which Russia feared would undermine strategic arms control...For all these reasons, Putin sought a back-channel to Washington which would remain operational whoever won the US election. The obvious choice, given Britain‚Äôs much vaunted ‚Äòspecial relationship‚Äô with the United States, was the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair.**."*

It is untrue, and it prevents the development of normal relations in Europe and in the world as a whole.‚Äô...That was not only the case in the West, however. On both sides of the former Iron Curtain, political and military leaders found it difficult to throw off Cold War thinking. It could scarcely have been otherwise.

Second, that it expected ‚Äòfull-fledged participation in decision-making‚Äô, or, as Tony Blair would say later, to have a seat at the top table. Third, that the legacy of the Cold War would not go away on its own: real efforts would be needed on both sides if it were to be surmounted. For the next twenty years or more, these would be the three key principles driving Russian policy towards the West and, above all, towards the former ‚Äòmain adversary‚Äô, the United States.**,"*

I wanted to hand him the cap of Monomakh‚Äô ‚Äì a reference to the fourteenth-century gold filigree crown which had been used at the coronation of Ivan the Terrible and had been part of the regalia of the Russian tsars ever since. Whatever Putin‚Äôs own feelings about the pomp and ceremony of the Kremlin, he was part of that tradition. Blair had noticed, when Putin accompanied him to the Mariinsky Theatre for a performance of War and Peace during his visit to St Petersburg, that ‚Äòpeople fell back as he approached, not in fear ‚Ä¶ but a little in awe and with reverence.

His rise to power had been the unintended but logical consequence of his career in St Petersburg and Moscow. But the realisation that he was no longer merely a candidate for the presidency, but the ruler of a huge, nuclear-armed, almost ungovernable country, emerging from a period of extraordinary social, political and economic turmoil, heavily indebted to its Western creditors and embroiled in a civil war in Chechnya, would have daunted even the boldest spirit.**."*

Towards the end of the discussion, a staff officer came in and handed Putin a note announcing that Russian soldiers had captured an important district centre in Chechnya. Illarionov, who was not a man to mince words, told Putin to his face that what Russia was doing there was a crime: 'For about 15 minutes, we had an interesting exchange. But, as you know, when people have ‚Äì to put it mildly ‚Äì slightly different views on a subject, the tone mounts ‚Ä¶ He did not raise his voice. It was different.

But a couple of days later, the telephone rang again and the same voice invited him to another meeting with Putin. More discussions followed. Illarionov accompanied Putin on trips to the provinces, where he noticed that the economic ideas which he had been promoting began to crop up in impromptu speeches. After a while, Putin‚Äôs speechwriters asked him to meet them and explain his thinking so that they could include it in what they wrote.**"*

But, ten days later, he was invited to yet another meeting to discuss Putin‚Äôs future economic programme, and there, for the first time, he had the impression that Putin was testing him. Was he just a windbag full of clever ideas, or did he want to do the hard work of trying to put them into practice? Afterwards, Putin asked him again: ‚ÄòAre you sure you don‚Äôt want to be my assistant?‚Äô This time, Illarionov said, he agreed. ‚ÄòHe had outsmarted me.'**

Even allowing that he may at certain points have embellished his account, what came across most starkly was Putin‚Äôs refusal to take no for an answer.21 Eighteen months earlier, Illarionov had been right about the default where everyone else had been wrong. Putin wanted him as his adviser and was not going to be deterred by disagreements over Chechnya, Illarionov‚Äôs repeated rejection of his overtures ‚Äì even in front of members of his cabinet ‚Äì or anything else.

When Mansky continued to hold to his own opinion, Putin said: ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt persuade everyone, unfortunately ‚Ä¶ Though it seems to me I‚Äôd be able to if I could talk to each one individually. Only that‚Äôs impossible.'.....Afterwards he would attempt to do just that with an annual phone-in programme, ‚ÄòDirect Line with Vladimir Putin‚Äô, often lasting more than four hours, where, in theory, viewers, or those lucky enough to be put through, could ask anything they wished. The first programme, in March 2001, was totally unscripted. Over time, that changed. Questions were filtered....the exercise became more formal and less informative. The same happened with meetings of the Valdai Club, which started as an informal discussion group where Putin would meet small groups of Western scholars for no-holds-barred conversations, only to metamorphose over time into an institutionalised propaganda forum with hundreds of attendees.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**There was a delicate balance to be struck between Russian tradition, which viewed the President as a modern autocrat, in a direct line from imperial times, and the exigencies of a modern European state, on the cusp of the twenty-first century, which saw itself as a nascent democracy, even if on Russian, rather than Western, terms. Putin was the symbol of that state. At the same time he had to appear approachable to those who formed his electoral base. It was not a unique dilemma: Western royalty also struggled to find a way to reconcile the mystique of monarchy with popular curiosity about their private lives. Putin‚Äôs ability to straddle that divide enabled him to end his first year in office with a more than 70 per cent approval rate. Izvestia wrote that autumn that as well as appearing presidential, he had managed to make ordinary Russians feel, ‚Äòhe‚Äôs just like me‚Äô, with the result that ‚Äòchanging one‚Äôs good opinion of Putin would require changing one‚Äôs good opinion of oneself, which is very hard to do.'**."*

Ten years later he told Vitaly Mansky: ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt interfere in the creative process. You‚Äôll make it the way you see fit ‚Ä¶ I just want to state my point of view and you decide if you use it or not.'....But that did not make him any less determined to ensure that the national media served as instruments of state power, and that any criticisms they might voice were within limits which the state laid down.**."*

Gusinsky was perceived as an oligarch ‚Äì a class of person whom most people loathed ‚Äì who was getting his comeuppance. ‚ÄòPutting an oligarch in prison has been an almost universal dream,‚Äô wrote Nezavisimaya gazeta. ‚ÄòWhy? In order to show that a struggle against corruption has begun in this country.‚Äô Putin emphasised that, too. ‚ÄòThe accusations levelled [against Gusinsky] were not as a journalist‚Äô, he said. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a businessman, an entrepreneur.‚Äô It was a useful way to distract attention from concerns about press freedom.**."*

It marked a significant step back from the free-wheeling anarchy of the early 1990s. But it needs to be seen in context....To many in the West, it seemed that Russia was reverting to its totalitarian past. Yet such words must be used with care. In a totalitarian state, the government exercises total control over what its citizens may say or write or, in extreme cases, even think. Putin‚Äôs Russia had become more authoritarian, less pluralistic, than Yeltsin‚Äôs. As Voloshin put it, ‚Äòthe degree of freedom was smaller ‚Ä¶ the degree of order, larger‚Äô. But there was no comparison with Soviet practice in the 1970s and early ‚Äô80s, let alone to a genuinely totalitarian state like China, where the media must follow to the letter the guidelines of the Central Committee‚Äôs Propaganda Department about what must as well as what cannot be said.**."*

The meaning of that enigmatic phrase in the Millennium Declaration, three and a half years earlier ‚Äì ‚ÄòThe state must be there as much as is necessary, freedom should be there as much as is required‚Äô ‚Äì was now clear. In Putin‚Äôs view, the truly ‚Äòmass‚Äô media, the national TV channels, had to be in the state‚Äôs hands. Other sources of information would be enough to provide the degree of freedom which, in his judgement, Russian society could reasonably be allowed to enjoy.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**The ultimate goal was to make the Chechens themselves responsible for the territory‚Äôs security. To that end, Kadyrov‚Äôs position was strengthened and Putin pushed for a greater role for the Chechen police. But there were enormous problems. The republic‚Äôs institutions had been destroyed and much of the economy, or what was left of it, was in the hands of criminals....Without peace and security, reconstruction was impossible. And until there was reconstruction, disaffected young men would continue to engage in banditry and smuggling and there would be no peace....Putin might insist till he was blue in the face that it was wrong to blame the Chechens as a nation for the jihad in their republic ‚Äì ‚ÄòTerrorists,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòhave neither nationality nor religion‚Äô ‚Äì but that did not change the behaviour of the troops on the ground...According to one opinion poll, only 20 per cent of Russians thought Putin would succeed in Chechnya ‚Äì a far cry from the overwhelming approval he had had when the war started.124 It had become a different kind of war, one commentator said, ‚Äòa war that can go on for years, a war that everyone is tired of'.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**Russia must end the war in Chechnya, they said. Otherwise they would blow up the theatre and everyone in it would die...Putin‚Äôs assurance that the top priority was to save the hostages, the endless succession of intermediaries, the message that Kazantsev was on his way to start talks, were a ploy to make the hostage-takers believe that the Kremlin might eventually agree to some of their demands and thus gain time to prepare an assault. Putin had never, for an instant, intended to negotiate. To compromise, he argued, would simply encourage further outrages. What was happening at the Dubrovka Theatre was the consequence of ‚Äòthe weakness of the state and the inconsistency of its actions‚Äô in the past ‚Äì a reference to the events at the hospital in Budyonnovsk in 1995, when Yeltsin had allowed the terrorists to go free to save the lives of the surviving hostages. There would be no repetition of that on Putin‚Äôs watch. ‚ÄòI want to stress,‚Äô he told the cabinet, ‚Äòthat Russia will not enter into any agreement with terrorists and will not yield to any blackmail.‚Äô...At 5 a.m. the following day, Russian special forces began pumping a powerful anaesthetic into the theatre‚Äôs air-conditioning system. Minutes later, they stormed the building. The hostage-takers were systematically killed, some in shoot-outs but most in cold blood. ‚ÄòWhen a woman is wearing two kilograms of plastic explosives,‚Äô one officer explained, ;there is no other way to disarm her.‚Äô But it also sent a message. ‚ÄòThe only good signal to terrorists,‚Äô Putin had said after the massacre at Kaspiisk, ‚Äòis a bullet in the head.'.**.*"

One hundred and twenty-five lost their lives during the rescue. Not only had the authorities refused to reveal the nature of the anaesthetic gas, which was a derivative of fentanyl, but there had been a total lack of coordination between the FSB and the rescue services. Almost all those who died could have been saved had medics been on hand immediately after the assault, properly briefed on how to treat them and equipped with breathing tubes to stop them choking to death.**."*

His goal was to show the insurgents ‚Äì not only their leader, Shamil Basayev, but also the rank and file who served as cannon fodder ‚Äì that such attacks would achieve nothing. If, in the process, there was collateral damage, that was unfortunate but secondary. ‚ÄòWe could not save everyone. Please forgive us,‚Äô Putin told the Russian people in a broadcast that night. ‚ÄòBut we proved that Russia cannot be brought to its knees.‚Äô The terrorists were fighting a losing battle, he said. ‚ÄòThey must be defeated and they will be defeated ‚Ä¶ They have no future.

The difficulty was that the generals, who were to implement this new approach, had neither the trained professionals, nor the specialised weaponry, nor, above all, the mindset to understand how ‚Äòpinpoint, targeted attacks‚Äô might be carried out. The Russian High Command had spent their careers thinking about large-scale conventional conflicts with the West, fighting war games and conducting military exercises because actual fighting never took place. Very few had ever led troops in combat and even fewer had any inkling of what effective anti-guerrilla tactics might look like.**."*

But when he flew in a helicopter over the bombed-out ruins of Grozny, even he was shocked to see how much remained to be done. The city, he admitted, still looked like a war zone.**..."*

It was discovered later that a mine had been hidden by building workers, probably months before, inside one of the ferro-concrete supporting pillars.

In the short term, Kadyrov had no obvious replacement. His son, Ramzan, was 27, and under the Chechen constitution would not be eligible for the presidency until he reached the age of 30. Putin could have changed that, but chose not to, partly because the jurist in him, no matter how the law might be twisted in practice, was reluctant to bring in special legislation, and partly to see how the young man would act.**."*

The key section was quite brief. ‚ÄòWe showed weakness,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòand the weak get beaten.‚Äô It was the same argument that he had made after Dubrovka. Russia was paying the price for the concessions made to Chechen fighters by Yeltsin‚Äôs government in the 1990s, which had made them believe that if they were ruthless enough, Moscow would always buckle and compromise. The root cause of the present troubles, Putin insisted, had been the break-up of the Soviet Union, which had unleashed ethnic tensions previously held in check by what he described as ‚Äòthe ruling ideology‚Äô ‚Äì a notably more euphemistic formulation than he had used ten years earlier, when he had spoken of the country being held together by barbed wire. Those divisions, he went on, were being exploited by international terrorism, which had declared war on Russia.

    The day after the siege ended, Putin said it had shown that Russia‚Äôs political system required adjustment. ‚ÄòMeasures must be taken to strengthen the country‚Äôs unity.‚Äô...To strengthen the ‚Äòexecutive power vertical‚Äô, he told them, governors would no longer be elected but appointed...‚ÄòGovernors should be professionals,‚Äô Putin had complained that summer, ‚Äònot just people who have a loud voice'...The Duma had until then consisted of 225 members from single-member constituencies and an equal number elected from party lists by proportional representation. Starting from the next election, Putin said, the single-member constituencies would be abolished and all 450 deputies elected from party lists. This would strengthen the role of the national parties, which should become ‚Äòone of the mechanisms ensuring dialogue and cooperation between society and the state‚Äô. That was something Putin had been pressing for ever since he had complained to Bill Clinton in 1999 that, in Russia, people voted for personalities, not for programmes or ideas. But his concept of the role that a political party should play was not quite the same as in a Western democracy. In Putin‚Äôs scheme of things, a party was a transmission belt ‚Äì an idea derived from his courses in Marxism‚ÄìLeninism when he had been a student ‚Äì which marshalled its supporters behind a political programme within parameters set by the state.192 Abolishing single-member constituencies, which might elect maverick deputies, impervious to party rules, would make parliamentary democracy easier to control.**."*

He had started in business during perestroika in the 1980s, ostensibly on behalf of the Komsomol, of which he was a junior official, to raise funds to make up for the shortfall in dues as young people lost interest and the membership declined. An import‚Äìexport cooperative followed, then a bank. Finally, in 1995, Khodorkovsky acquired a 78 per cent stake in Yukos, then the country‚Äôs second-largest oil producer, in one of the so-called ‚Äòloans-for-shares‚Äô auctions, in which Yeltsin had pledged state-owned enterprises as collateral for cash advances to plug the budget deficit and pay wages arrears before the 1996 presidential election. Like all the ‚Äòloans-for-shares‚Äô deals, Khodorkovsky‚Äôs acquisition was controversial...It was also true, however, that, given the political and economic uncertainties of Russia in the mid 1990s, any investment was a huge gamble.....Yukos prospered because Khodorkovsky, an iron-willed workaholic, reinvested the company‚Äôs profits in new technology and infrastructure and hired Western consultants, to reform the management structure and introduce modern accounting practices. Habitual drunkards were fired ‚Äì an unheard-of measure in the Russian oil business ‚Äì and production costs were reduced by two thirds...Yukos soon acquired a reputation as a well-run company espousing Western principles of business practice.....a number of businessmen and officials who tried to block Yukos‚Äôs expansion in the 1990s ended up dead. Khodorkovsky later described those years as being a time of ‚Äòprimary capital accumulation ‚Ä¶ If you conducted yourself too much in a western manner, you were simply torn to pieces and forgotten.'...Khodorkovsky established the Open Russia Foundation...**"*

    - Chapter 11 - "A Bonfire of Illusions" - *"**There were grounds for optimism on both sides. Clinton, like Tony Blair in Britain, believed that Russia under Putin could become a reliable partner for the West. ‚ÄòHis intentions are generally honourable and straightforward,‚Äô he told Blair.

    - *"**More irritating, though little was said about it, was the way the United States appeared to think it had a droit de regard over Russia‚Äôs Near Abroad. America‚Äôs interest, Clinton told Putin, was to see that Russia had ‚Äògood, stable relations with its neighbours‚Äô. Russians of all political persuasions found that exasperating. It came across as patronising, reflecting America‚Äôs self-image as the undisputed leader of a unipolar world. In response, Putin mentioned casually that he had just visited Cuba, intending it as a delicate reminder that America‚Äôs own relations with its neighbours were not always either good or stable. But Clinton did not, or chose not to, notice.**."*
    - *"**The one real cloud on the horizon was America‚Äôs proposed National Missile Defense system...The downside was that it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which Russia regarded as the foundation of the entire edifice of nuclear arms control that had been painstakingly erected, treaty by treaty, since the first agreements had been signed in Moscow by Brezhnev and Richard Nixon 30 years before....In Moscow‚Äôs view, the moment the door was opened to nuclear missile defence, even if in the first instance it was limited to preventing small-scale attacks by rogue actors, there would be no way to stop its further development and the logic of deterrence would collapse...**."*

The United States is Russia‚Äôs partner.'...On the other hand, Putin started pushing much harder on their points of discord. There were forces in the West, he said, that continued to view Russia as ‚Äòthe main geopolitical enemy‚Äô. The Warsaw Pact had been dissolved and the Soviet Union no longer existed. ‚ÄòBut NATO still exists. What for?‚Äô How could Russia feel at ease with NATO expansion, when it was itself excluded? It was a fair question. ‚ÄòWe all say ‚Äì I hear it all the time from my [Western] colleagues and the mass media in the West talk about it constantly ‚Äì we say: 'We don‚Äôt want Europe to be divided, we don‚Äôt want new borders and barriers, new ‚ÄòBerlin Walls‚Äô dividing the continent.'

On their personal relationship, Bush was even more fulsome: 'I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialogue. I was able to get a sense of his soul: a man deeply committed to his country and to the best interests of his country.'

That was why he had telephoned the White House even before the dust from the explosions had settled, the first foreign leader to do so, a gesture which Bush appreciated and did not forget, and why, over the following days, he surprised the American President by offering fuller cooperation than anyone in the White House had thought possible.

Bush claimed that America needed a missile defence system to guard against ‚Äòterrorists who might acquire weapons of mass destruction to be delivered by ballistic missiles‚Äô. The Russians found that risible. ‚ÄòNeither terrorists nor rogue states have strategic ballistic missiles,‚Äô Putin exclaimed, ‚Äòand they are unlikely ever to get them.‚Äô The truth, as the Russians quickly realised, was that the Pentagon still hoped to develop a missile defence system which, like Star Wars, would protect America from a Russian second strike, making a nuclear war winnable. The United States insisted it had no such intention. That was flat-out dishonest. If, as Clinton had told Blair, America knew that the missile defence system would upset the nuclear balance with China, it followed that further development would upset the balance with Russia. In any case, as Putin kept pointing out, intentions did not matter. What counted was the capability the system would confer. Putin thought the United States was wasting its money. Even if the new missile defence system worked, which was far from certain, it would serve no useful purpose. Russia had more than enough missiles to penetrate American defences and would respond by developing more.**."*

On certain issues, he suggested, notably the fight against terrorism and nuclear non-proliferation, Russia and the 19 members of NATO, instead of meeting bilaterally as ‚Äò19 plus one‚Äô, as had been the case until then, should form a unified ‚ÄòGroup of 20‚Äô, which would have the power to agree joint policies. Putin leapt at the idea. ‚ÄòWe are ready to go as far as the North Atlantic bloc is ready to go‚Äô, he said. ‚ÄòIf the format of our relationship changes, NATO enlargement will cease to be an issue.'...Unsurprisingly, NATO opted for the more modest variant...It sounded wonderful. ‚ÄòEach nation will have one vote,‚Äô Putin jubilated, ‚Äòand all the issues will be resolved without any prior decisions being taken within the bloc.'...Bush: 'For decades, Russia and NATO were adversaries. Those days are gone.‚Äô If Estonia wanted to join NATO, Putin said, ‚ÄòLet it do so if it thinks it will be happier that way. I see no tragedy there ‚Ä¶ The choice of any nation must be respected.'

There were sound reasons for that. Well over half of Russia‚Äôs foreign trade was with Western countries. Russia‚Äôs future growth depended on its integration into the world economy, which, in the early 2000s, was still dominated by the United States, the European Union and Japan...

Others help them. They help, reasoning that Russia, as one of the world‚Äôs major nuclear powers, still poses a certain threat to somebody. So that threat must be removed. Terrorism is naturally just an instrument for achieving these aims.'.....It was ‚Äòa replay of the mentality of the Cold War‚Äô, he said.

Many assumed that Putin was reacting emotionally to the carnage at Beslan, in the same way that he himself had interpreted the invasion of Iraq as an emotional reaction to 9/11, and that the moment would pass. That was a misreading. Looking back over the four years of his first presidential term, from 2000 to 2004, Putin felt, with some justification, that he had put himself out on a limb to help the United States after the terrorist attacks.

American officials saw things differently. They focused instead on Russian backsliding over human rights and democracy issues. Putin‚Äôs construction of a ‚Äòpower vertical‚Äô had made Russia by 2004 a more authoritarian country than four years earlier. But few Russians thought that that was any of America‚Äôs business. Even liberals who excoriated Putin‚Äôs regime jibbed at heavy-handed foreign criticism.

Like Gorbachev, Putin regarded the break-up of the USSR as a tragedy which could never be undone...‚ÄòHe who does not regret the destruction of the Soviet Union has no heart, he who wants to see it recreated in its former shape has no brain.‚Äô...Yet precisely because of that accumulated history, when, by Putin‚Äôs own admission, the Soviet Union had been ‚Äòheld together with barbed wire‚Äô, the Kremlin‚Äôs relations with the Near Abroad were mind-numbingly complicated and difficult to manage.

But his regime turned out to be repressive, deeply corrupt and either unable or unwilling to prevent Chechen rebels establishing sanctuaries near their common border...The relationship fluctuated between bad and terrible. Occasionally Putin acknowledged that Russia‚Äôs problems with Georgia, like those which bedevilled its relations with all the other former Soviet republics, stemmed from Russia‚Äôs long history of imperial domination. ‚ÄòThe blame is not all on Georgia‚Äôs side,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòGeorgia fears Russia‚Äôs imperial ambitions.'...It was in Georgia, in November 2003, that the first of what became known as the ‚Äòcolour revolutions‚Äô occurred...Rose Revolution..Mikheil Saakashvili...The Bush administration viewed Georgia as a US bridgehead in the Caucasus, counteracting Russian influence in the region. Under Shevardnadze, America had given Georgia economic aid and a military training programme and had supported the construction of the Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan oil pipeline, which would reduce the country‚Äôs dependence on Russian energy supplies. Georgia, in turn, had sent troops to fight with the coalition in Iraq....On the crucial issue of separatism, he reiterated Russia‚Äôs support for Georgia‚Äôs territorial integrity.

Yanukovych, as even some Russian commentators acknowledged, had been a weak candidate, unable to gain broad support outside his own fiefdoms in Donetsk and Luhansk. But this was not how Putin saw it.

Asked many years later what had influenced him most and what he would most like to be able to undo, he replied: ‚ÄòThe Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse‚Äô.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**At the end of 2005, another of the consequences of the Soviet break-up came home to roost. Ukraine still paid for Russian gas supplies by an arcane system of barter. Ever since Putin had been in charge of foreign trade in St Petersburg, he had favoured moving to market relations, under which Ukraine and the other post-Soviet states which benefitted from what had been called ‚Äòfriendship prices‚Äô, often three or four times lower than those practised elsewhere, would start paying at the same rate as Western Europe. Russia had been for too long ‚Äòa milch-cow for all and sundry‚Äô, he said, subsiding oil and gas supplies to the other CIS members to the tune of several billion dollars a year.**.."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**Putin offered Ukraine a loan to cover the difference between the ‚Äòfriendship‚Äô and the market price, but emphasised that it would have to be guaranteed by an international bank and eventually reimbursed. Yushchenko refused. Finally, on December 31, Putin suggested a compromise: Russia would continue to supply gas in the first quarter of 2006 at the present price, provided Ukraine agreed to transition to market rates thereafter. Again, Yushchenko refused. Accordingly, on January 1, 2006, Gazprom shut off the supply. Three days later, the Ukrainian President capitulated, an agreement was signed providing for a gradual transition to market prices and supplies resumed. It was not the first time Russia had shut off the gas. Two years earlier, Gazprom had cut supplies to Belarus during a similar dispute. But on that occasion the only other countries affected were Poland and Lithuania. This time, Austria, France and Italy, as well as much of Eastern Europe, found their gas supply cut off.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**‚ÄúThe effects were twofold. Although European governments had some sympathy for Putin‚Äôs position ‚Äì the Ukrainians were behaving badly; there was no reason at all for them not to pay the market rate ‚Äì most of the Western news media, which had little interest in the technicalities of long-term gas contracts, saw it as crude Russian bullying. Public opinion, already disenchanted with Putin and his regime, became further disabused. Equally if not more important, the issue of energy security, and the vexed question of whether Europe was becoming too dependent on Russian oil and gas, was put firmly back on the agenda. That had been an American hobby horse ever since the Reagan administration had tried to block the construction of a Russian gas pipeline to Western Europe in the 1980s. But now it took on additional significance because, apart from geopolitical considerations, Washington was seeking European markets for US exports of Liquefied Natural Gas.**."*
    - *"...Russia‚Äôs energy relations with its former Soviet neighbours are like an awful divorce process. [But] moving to cold hard contracts may mark the end of the heavy-handed use of energy as a political bludgeon, not the beginning, [and] we are all likely to be better off in the end.'."*

Other actions by the Russian government have been counterproductive and could begin to affect relations with other countries. No legitimate interest is served when oil and gas become tools of intimidation or blackmail ‚Ä¶ Russia has a choice to make ‚Ä¶ None of us believes that Russia is fated to become an enemy.'...The implication was that if Russia did not change its ways, it would indeed become an enemy. A Western diplomat in Moscow called it ‚Äòthe most abrasive speech against Russia‚Äô since Reagan had spoken at the Brandenburg Gate in 1987 and urged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall...Putin‚Äôs response: 'The wolf knows who to eat,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòHow quickly the pathetic utterances about human rights and democracy are laid aside when one‚Äôs own interests come to the fore!‚Äô In plain English, Cheney was a hypocrite and America a predator whose default reaction was not to try to work out differences but to resort to force.**."*

The gas dispute marked the beginning of a profound change in Russia‚Äôs attitude both to its neighbours and to the West. The days when Putin would lean over backwards to avoid unnecessarily antagonising the United States and its European allies were long gone. The Russian economy seemed strong. Oil prices were at record highs. The country had paid off its foreign debts, depriving the West of an important source of leverage. Putin‚Äôs popularity was consistently above 70 per cent. For the first time, Russia had begun to flex its muscles, demonstrating its newfound power. It had not done so very skilfully. Putin admitted that Russia had explained its case poorly..But he had shown that he was prepared to be tough in defence of what he saw as Russia‚Äôs interests, even if it led to problems with the West, and that went down well with Russians.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**By the summer of 2006, Putin had concluded that he had nothing further to lose by giving Britain a hard time. Russia‚Äôs most important partner was the EU and, in his view, its leading members were ‚ÄòGermany, France, Italy and Spain‚Äô, in that order. Britain, which three years earlier he had described as the key to Russia‚Äôs integration with the European economy, no longer even got a mention. Blair‚Äôs government was seen as so subservient to the United States that it would never act independently. Whatever happened to Moscow‚Äôs relationship with Washington, for better or worse, Putin thought, Britain would follow meekly behind.**."*

Why did he do it? Litvinenko was a has-been as far as Moscow was concerned....There were other exiles in London whom the Kremlin regarded as a much greater threat....Yet that may have been the point. Litvinenko was not a high-profile opponent. His murder was symbolic and, had the British police not discovered the polonium trail, Moscow would not have suffered any adverse consequences. His killing followed the passage of a new law by the Duma giving the security services increased powers to act against ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô and ‚Äòextremists‚Äô abroad. It was an odd piece of legislation. The Russian special services had never previously required legal authority to murder exiled opponents...But the law and Litvinenko‚Äôs murder had the same purpose: they were a warning to Russian expatriates not to get out of line.**."*

He had known that there was a chance ‚Äì probably a good chance, given the tendency of all secret services to screw up ‚Äì that Litvinenko‚Äôs murder would be traced back to Russia. If he had decided to go ahead, it was not merely because, by the summer of 2006, he had largely given up on Britain, but more importantly because he was beginning to have serious doubts about Russia‚Äôs future relationship with America. Ever since Putin had become President, six years earlier, his goal had been to forge a close relationship with the West. Now he was beginning to wonder whether that was even possible.**."*

As a result we do not have sufficient strength to find a comprehensive solution to any of them. Their political settlement also becomes impossible.

And who likes this? Who likes it?'... Attempts were being made, he said, to impose a unipolar system, in which there would be ‚Äòone centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making, ‚Ä¶ a world in which there is one master, one sovereign‚Äô. That was unacceptable and undemocratic. Russia, Putin said, was ‚Äòconstantly being lectured about democracy. But for some reason, those who teach us do not want to learn themselves.‚Äô Unipolarity was pernicious ‚Äònot only for those within the system, but also for the sovereign [power] because it destroys itself from within‚Äô. In a world where the combined economies of China, India and other rising powers would soon be larger than that of America, it was inevitable that, sooner or later, whether the United States wished it or not, a multipolar system would develop. ... After the Cold War, Putin went on, ideological stereotypes and relics of bloc thinking had been left lying around ‚Äòlike live ammunition‚Äô. The United States and its allies had transformed the OSCE, which had been established as a multilateral organisation, into ‚Äòa vulgar instrument to promote [their] foreign policy interests‚Äô. The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe was in ‚Äòa pitiable state‚Äô as a result of arguments about the presence of Russian troops in Georgia and Transnistria and the United States‚Äô decision to build forward bases in Bulgaria and Romania. The US National Missile Defense system would not only spark a new arms race, which no one in Europe needed, but, should it ever be developed to a point where it could neutralise Russia‚Äôs strategic systems, the nuclear ‚Äúbalance which had kept the peace for the previous half-century would be totally destroyed.**."*

But dealing with the conflicts which had set Whites against Reds almost a century before was easier than achieving consensus on more recent history...The touchiest issue was Stalin: murderous tyrant to some, heroic wartime leader to others. For most of his first two terms, Putin tacked first one way, then the other. Stalin, he said, had been ‚Äògreatly to blame for the failures of the first year or year and a half of the war‚Äô, refusing to believe warnings that Hitler was preparing to invade. He also bore responsibility for ‚Äòthe tragedy of deportation‚Äô, when entire nations, mainly in the Caucasus, were uprooted from their homes and exiled to Central Asia, because he feared they might collaborate with the Germans. But those criticisms were offset by the unveiling of a huge bronze plaque in the Kremlin‚Äôs Palace of Congresses, glorifying Stalin‚Äôs wartime role....When it came to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop pact, under which, in 1939, Russia and Nazi Germany had agreed to divide up Eastern Europe between them, Putin tried to satisfy both sides. On the one hand, it had been a ‚Äòpersonal decision by Stalin‚Äô, not in the interests of the Soviet people, he declared. On the other, it had been necessary as a response to the Munich agreement, which Britain and France had signed with Hitler the previous year, hoping to sit out the war while Germany and the Soviet Union destroyed each other.  To find a middle course in a debate where passions were even more inflamed than over Lenin was impossible. It was one thing to argue over essentially symbolic issues ‚Äì quite another when Stalin‚Äôs iron rule had affected every Russian family and was seared into every memory. Everyone had a friend, or a brother or sister, or a cousin or a father or an uncle or a grandparent, who had been sent to a labour camp from which they either had or had not returned.**."*

In the summer of 2007, he finally got round to doing something about it. A teachers‚Äô manual was produced under the watchful eye of Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin ideologist, followed by a textbook for high-school students. The guiding principles were that the history of the tsarist empire, the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia should be treated as a single, continuous whole, and that the positive aspects of Russian history should be emphasised, rather than ‚Äòthe black pages‚Äô. Putin called it ‚Äòobjective and thorough‚Äô. Others saw it as a ‚Äòlacquering‚Äô of history. ‚ÄòIn Russia, only the past is unpredictable‚Äô, one commentator wrote wryly, reprising an old Soviet joke. In Putin‚Äôs new authorised version, Stalin‚Äôs despotism was depicted as having created the necessary conditions for modernising the country‚Äôs economy. 'Bolsheviks were able to fulfil this task only by violence,‚Äô the textbook explained. ‚ÄòThey had no other instruments for modernising Russia, so violence was inevitable.‚Äô It criticised Khrushchev for ‚Äòhare-brained schemes‚Äô; praised Brezhnev for having, like Putin, brought stability; accused Gorbachev of having brought about the break-up of the Soviet Union, but also grudgingly gave him credit for, as Putin put it, ‚Äòdestroying a system which Russians could endure no longer‚Äô. Yeltsin was criticised for his ‚Äòcrisis-ridden governance‚Äô but praised for ‚Äògiving Russians freedom, indisputably the great achievement of the Yeltsin era‚Äô. Putin‚Äôs own presidency was described as a time of efficient government and democracy...Amid all his conflicting statements, it is hard to pin down what Putin really thought of Stalin. He probably came closest to revealing his own opinion when he said: ‚ÄòStalin was certainly a tyrant, many call him a criminal, but he was not a Nazi.'.**"*

Americans, with help from the mythmakers of Hollywood, like to believe that the United States, aided by the plucky British, played the main role in defeating Hitler‚Äôs Germany. Winston Churchill, addressing the House of Commons in August 1944, was more lucid. ‚ÄòThe obvious, essential fact,‚Äô he declared, ‚Äò[is] that it is the Russian armies who have done the main work in tearing the guts out of the German army ‚Ä¶ No force in the world which could have been called into being ‚Ä¶ would have been able to maul and break [the Nazi regime] unless it had been subjected to the terrible slaughter that has fallen to it through the strength of the Soviet Russian armies.‚Äô...Russia lost 27 million people, 15 per cent of the population, during the war, a gargantuan blood-letting from which the country has still not recovered. For Russians, it was the defining event of the twentieth century, overshadowing the Bolshevik Revolution, the Civil War, the horrors of Stalin‚Äôs purges and the collapse of communism. The memory of those who fought in it was capable as nothing else of uniting the nation in homage.

The principles of tsarist rule were ‚ÄòOrthodoxy, Autocracy and National Essence‚Äô, the last of which signified that Russia should cleave to its own traditions and eschew foreign influences. In Soviet times, the Church was repressed. But, during perestroika and especially after 1991, it re-emerged, in Putin‚Äôs words, ‚Äòlike grass in a big city which grows up through the asphalt‚Äô.

If his interlocutor agreed all the time and had nothing original to contribute, he quickly lost interest.

Gerrymandering, voting restrictions, ballot-stuffing and all the other techniques for falsifying election results were not invented in Russia.

The Kremlin was already nervous because of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, which it saw as a stark warning of where popular dissension could lead if allowed to get out of hand.

To all intents and purposes, after 2007, structural economic reform was abandoned....Russia‚Äôs newfound oil wealth affected the regime in multiple ways.

    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"..**But it was the Rotenbergs who provided the clearest illustration of how the new system worked. After Putin gained control of Gazprom in 2001, the brothers began investing, often with loans provided by Bank Rossiya, in construction and pipeline companies which were given inflated Gazprom contracts. A 1,500-mile-long pipeline which the Rotenbergs built from a new gas field in northern Russia came in at 44 billion US dollars, three times more than a pipeline of equivalent length in Europe. Gazprom sold the brothers five construction and maintenance companies, all at a knockdown price, which they merged and transformed into one of Russia‚Äôs largest building firms. That was followed by highway construction, urban development and even educational publishing...The simple explanation was that the authorities gave lucrative contracts to companies run by members of Putin‚Äôs inner circle, allowing them to make inordinate profits at the state‚Äôs expense. As one gas industry analyst put it, ‚ÄòGazprom switched from a principle of maximising shareholder profits to one of maximising contractor profits.‚Äô... There was actually a little more to it than that. Men like Arkady Rotenberg were canny organisers whose success owed much to their relationships with Putin and other members of the political elite but was also due to their own business acumen. As well as providing the Kremlin with a pool of money for unrecorded expenditures, they could be relied on to undertake major, prestige projects and get them done. They were rewarded accordingly....In America, that would be called crony capitalism which, indeed, it was. To Russians, it increasingly resembled the imperial court of pre-Bolshevik times.**."*

In return for their support, the new aristocracy were granted not serfs and land, as would have been the case under the tsars, but the opportunity to make their fortunes through government largesse.

His future will be assured, as Yeltsin‚Äôs was, not by money but by the protection of those who come after him...There are other reasons to doubt that Putin has great private wealth. As President, he has access to anything he could wish for. If he gives away a 20,000-dollar Blancpain watch to a schoolboy, it is because he can. In his position, such sums are of no consequence. His daughters are well provided for. Both married wealthy businessmen. In St Petersburg, while accepting ‚Äòexpressions of gratitude‚Äô from trusted friends, he consistently refused to do anything which might make him beholden to those who sought his help. It is possible that he has behaved differently as President, but it appears highly unlikely. As Russia‚Äôs ruler, manipulating the elite clans and interest groups which form the basis of his support, Putin could not allow himself to behave as they did, even if he wished to. He had to operate on a higher plane, because if he abased himself to their level he would risk losing control. The much-quoted Panama Papers showed that many of his personal friends had millions or billions of dollars stashed away in fiscal paradises and that, like most of the ultra-rich, they tried to hide their wealth. But there was nothing in the Panama Papers to suggest that Putin himself had illicit riches concealed in offshore accounts.....‚ÄòMy personal view,‚Äô said Morell, ‚Äòis that money doesn‚Äôt matter to him very much. Not personally. Money matters to him to buy the support he needs from the elite.

In the words of one observer who had watched them working together over the years: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no daylight between them.‚Äô...With hindsight, it is legitimate to ask whether Sergei Ivanov was ever anything more than a foil whose role was to maintain the suspense, in the same way that Yeltsin had played with Stepashin before appointing Putin....That was not how it looked at the time. Most of the Russian political elite, not to mention Western observers, thought he had a better chance than Medvedev of coming out on top.

Russian diplomats assured their US counterparts that nothing of the kind was contemplated. Moscow had intelligence, they said, that Saakashvili had been discussing the possibility of a lightning campaign to reoccupy former Georgian-populated areas along the Abkhazian border and then dig in while awaiting Western diplomatic support. Russia was merely bolstering its forces there to dissuade him from doing anything rash....It was not implausible. The Georgian leaders were emotional and hot-headed, and the US and the Europeans were constantly warning them not get into sucked into a conflict with Russia that they could not possibly win. Saakashvili was obsessed by fears that Abkhazia and South Ossetia would slowly slip from Georgia‚Äôs grasp if the status quo persisted and they would then be definitely lost. He was wrong. So long as the conflict remained frozen, nothing would change. But Saakashvili‚Äôs government and its Western backers talked past each other ‚Äì the Georgians desperate to recover their territory, their allies insistent that they do nothing which might provoke the Russian military to respond.**."*

No matter how much the Kremlin spent on PR agencies like Ketchum, it would never be able to compete with that...The conflict would indeed trigger a Russian invasion ‚Äì an invasion totally disproportionate to the original offence ‚Äì but that was not how it began.

The Georgian offensive took the Russians by surprise. Next morning, Saakashvili‚Äôs ground forces occupied the South Ossetian capital, now in ruins after the Georgian bombardment. The Russians scrambled to bring in extra units, in many cases staffed by conscripts who had no idea what they were supposed to be doing.8 It took them until the following day to drive the Georgians out....But in the broader scheme of things, it was a fatal error...The Russians had begun contingency planning for a conflict with Georgia as early as 2006.

Putin accused the Georgians of ethnic cleansing in Ossetia, the same argument that NATO had used to justify taking action against the Serbs. Russia portrayed Saakashvili as a latter day Milo≈°eviƒá, and the Ossetians as oppressed by Tbilisi in the same way as the Kosovars had been oppressed by Belgrade. Most of that was a stretch. But the West‚Äôs hypocrisy in pretending that Kosovo was a ‚Äòspecial case‚Äô ‚Äì an argument rejected by Cyprus, Greece and Spain and other states facing separatist movements, including Georgia itself ‚Äì had finally come home to roost...Kosovo was not the proximate cause of the war with Georgia. It became inevitable only after the American overreach at Bucharest, when Bush and Condoleezza Rice had pushed through an ill-considered commitment to grant Ukraine and Georgia NATO membership. The Bush administration had assumed that Russia would accept a fourth round of NATO enlargement after the Visegr√°d states in 1999, the Baltic States and East and Central Europeans in 2004, and the accession of Albania and Croatia, which would take place the following spring. Ambassador Burns and others had warned that this time Putin would dig in his heels. The White House had not listened...That was compounded by another error. When Sergei Lavrov declared after Bucharest that Russia would do everything in its power to ensure that Georgia and Ukraine did not join NATO ‚Äì a warning repeated a month later during a visit to NATO headquarters by the Russian Chief of Staff, General Baluyevsky ‚Äì the White House did not take that seriously either....The result was that a lame duck American President, who had alienated many of his European colleagues, found himself powerless to protect an ally whose adventurism had been abetted by the political, military and economic support his administration had provided....For Georgia the war was a disaster. The two territories Saakashvili had wished to recover were irretrievably lost...For the United States, the consequences were more nuanced. Bush would shortly be succeeded by a Democrat, Barack Obama, who would try a new approach to Russia. But Bush had left a troubling legacy. The spectacle of American forces bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq had shown that the United States, even if it had become the world‚Äôs sole superpower, was not the all-powerful hegemon it had imagined itself to be. The Georgian war convinced Putin that, in a battle of wills with Russia, America was not invincible either.**."*

The need for change had become painfully evident, he said, when, as Prime Minister in the autumn of 1999, Yeltsin had given him charge of the war in Chechnya. Out of 1.4 million men in the armed forces, only 55,000 were in combat-ready units and they were dispersed all over the country. ‚ÄòThat is how we ended up sending into battle kids untested by fire to be butchered‚Äô, Putin said. ‚ÄòI will not forget that ever.‚Äô The following year he approved plans gradually to transition to a fully professional army.....The root of the problem was the mindset..The Soviet army, like the tsarist army before it, had been based on the idea of mass mobilisation. The Russian military followed the same model. From the standpoint of the officer corps, the system had distinct advantages. In the early 2000s, the Russian army had more colonels than lieutenants and one officer for every two ordinary ranks. The huge officer corps was needed, it was claimed, in case one day the civilian population had to be drafted in time of war...But as well as being the foundation of the system, conscription was its Achilles‚Äô heel. The falling birth rate since the 1980s meant that there were no longer enough draftees to go round, and since wealthier and better educated students usually managed to avoid serving, the quality of the recruits was lamentable....it was announced that conscripts would no longer be sent to Chechnya or other war zones....On paper, it looked like a great success. The Georgian war showed that in practice it had been a total failure....The failure of the modernisation programme was blamed on the Defence Minister, Sergei Ivanov. But Putin was also responsible. Having initially embraced the concept of a fully professional army, he had got cold feet....By 2011, the army command had been forced to accept that, no matter what it did, demographic considerations made a conscript army impossible. In any case, hi-tech weaponry needed skilled professionals, not cannon fodder. The General Staff announced that the transition to a fully professional force would continue and that the draft might end completely in 2017. That did not happen, but from 2012 onwards, the makeup of the armed forces stabilised.... Financial constraints were partly responsible: contract personnel cost much more than conscripts. But Putin and others in the political elite also saw the draft as promoting patriotism and maintaining the link between the military and the civilian population. In Western countries where conscription had been abolished, civilians‚Äô readiness to fight in defence of the homeland had notably declined.**."*

The collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, fuelled by risky bank lending ‚Äì the so-called sub-prime mortgage crisis ‚Äì was about to trigger what would become known as the Great Recession. In September, the US investment bank, Lehmann Brothers, failed. A cascade of even bigger failures was prevented only by huge taxpayer-funded bailouts. Between a fifth and a quarter of American household wealth was wiped out. Consumption fell precipitously, credit dried up and investment ground to a halt. The old adage, ‚Äòwhen America sneezes, Europe catches a cold‚Äô, showed its truth yet again. But in the new, globalised world of the twenty-first century, it was not just Europe that suffered. Every country was affected....Putin tried to see a positive side to the crisis. The problems in the United States, he said, were ‚Äòa further step towards strengthening a multipolar world‚Äô. The American system had shown itself incapable of resolving the problems it created. ‚ÄòFaith in the United States as leader of the free world and the free market ‚Ä¶ has been undermined, I think forever,‚Äô he said, in an access of wishful thinking. ‚ÄòIt will never return to what it was before.'....By October, the Russian stock market had fallen 75 per cent from its May highs and trading was suspended so frequently that Russians joked it was like a cuckoo clock.40 The price of oil, which touched an all-time high of 129 US dollars a barrel for Urals crude in July, was down to 40 dollars a barrel nine months later, before recovering to 70 dollars by the end of 2009. Russia‚Äôs 25 wealthiest men saw their assets slashed by 230 billion dollars over the course of a few months. But, initially at least, ordinary people were not affected. Only one per cent of the population owned shares and one in three had no bank account. Russia had 600 billion dollars in foreign-exchange reserves, which supported the value of the rouble, and the Stabilisation Fund made up for the shortfall in budget revenue. Despite price hikes, growing arrears of unpaid wages and rising unemployment, protests remained limited. Memories of the 1990s, when shock therapy had caused much greater economic pain, were sufficiently recent for people to think twice before going out onto the streets and, in the second half of 2009, once oil prices had started to recover, the recession began to ease....Nonetheless, it was a turning point. For the next decade or more, the Russian economy essentially stagnated. Putin‚Äôs hopes of transitioning to a skills-based economic model, which he had unveiled with great fanfare during the 2008 election campaign, were quietly abandoned. Even in the best of circumstances, that would have been a stretch. He had proposed that by 2020, labour productivity would quadruple, Russia would become one of the top five nations in terms of GDP after the US, China, Japan and Germany, the middle class would make up 60 to 70 per cent of the population and average life expectancy ‚Äì still only 68 years in 2008 ‚Äì would increase to 75. The last target was almost met: in 2020, Russian life expectancy reached 73 years, eight and a half years more than in the mid 1990s, though that was still not enough to arrest the country‚Äôs long-term demographic decline. But the other goals were unattainable. By 2020, nominal GDP had fallen back to the level of 2007. Far from becoming one of the top five global economies, Russia slipped from tenth to eleventh place.**."*

    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**In relations with the West, formally at least, Medvedev was in the driving seat....But uncertainty continued over how much authority he really possessed...Watching Medvedev and Obama at the UN General Assembly in September 2009, she had noticed how similar their body language was. ‚ÄòMedvedev could work with Obama,‚Äô she said, ‚Äòbut he hadn‚Äôt enough power. So that made it more difficult.....It took time for the US administration to realise that its assumption that Medvedev and Putin were essentially on the same wavelength on foreign policy issues was not necessarily correct. ‚ÄòWhat became clear, but wasn‚Äôt clear to us initially was that Medvedev was pushing out in front of Putin and trying to create his own political identity as someone who could work with the West.‚Äô The problem was that neither the Americans nor Medvedev himself could be sure how far he could push before he exceeded the limits which Putin would accept. Ideally, Rhodes acknowledged, the White House should have tried harder to keep lines to Putin open, but in practice that was all but impossible because of the Prime Minister‚Äôs insistence that, in matters of US‚ÄìRussian relations, Medvedev was in charge.**."*

During the primary campaign, she had asserted that, since Putin had been a KGB agent, ‚Äòby definition he does not have a soul‚Äô. It was a riff on Bush‚Äôs statement at Ljubljana that he had looked into Putin‚Äôs eyes and ‚Äògot a sense of his soul‚Äô. Putin had taken note. ‚ÄòI think, as a minimum,‚Äô he said acidly, ‚Äòa state official needs to have a head.‚Äô .....Clinton‚Äôs distrust of Russia, which she wore as a badge of honour, was not the best basis on which to seek a fresh beginning.....To change the subject, she asked him about his conservation efforts for Siberian tigers. His demeanour changed instantly, she wrote, and he got up and took her down a long corridor and through an armoured door to his private office, where he launched into an animated discussion ‚Äì in English, which he never normally spoke during negotiations with foreign visitors ‚Äì about tigers and polar bears and other endangered species. He was going to Franz Josef Land in the Russian Arctic later that spring to tag polar bears, he said. Would her husband like to come with him?....It could have been an opening. She did not follow up.

Beyrle‚Äôs father, Joseph, had parachuted into France during the Normandy landings, been captured by the Germans and sent to a prison camp in the East, from which he escaped and joined a Soviet tank regiment, becoming, it was said, the only American to serve both with US forces and the Red Army during World War II. In Russia, where the war is seen as the defining moment of the country‚Äôs modern history, such things have immense importance. Ambassador Beyrle had the respect of the Kremlin not merely because of his position but because of his family history. McFaul was an academic who described himself as a ‚Äòspecialist in democracy, movements against dictatorship and revolutions‚Äô, an ardent supporter of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and a severe critic of Putin and his regime. To Moscow, it was the kind of appointment that a foreign government would make if it wished to implement a strategy of tension. It had apparently never occurred to anyone in the White House that Putin might not take kindly to the ‚Äú nomination of someone with McFaul‚Äôs views and antecedents...Whether it would have made any difference if Beyrle had stayed on or if Hillary Clinton had been more empathetic to Russian concerns is another matter. Personal chemistry is important and its absence can be a drawback. But it does not change underlying realities.**."*

However, it appeared that what was to follow had been left deliberately vague. It would have made no sense for Putin to commit himself one way or the other until he saw how Medvedev performed. Part of the point of the exercise was to find out whether the younger man was a possible long-term successor. Putin had no desire to stay in power for life, as was the case of some of his fellow leaders in Central Asia, and given the nature of the system he presided over, the succession was a matter of vital concern...Sometime in 2010, around the midpoint of his presidency, Medvedev started to believe that Putin was open to the idea of him standing for a second term.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**But then Medvedev began pushing a little bit too hard...Medvedev gave a speech in St Petersburg to mark the 150th anniversary of the abolition of serfdom. Ostensibly about Russian history, it was widely viewed as a coded appeal to Russian liberals. ‚ÄòFreedom cannot be postponed,‚Äô Medvedev said. ‚ÄòThe nation ‚Ä¶ cannot be kept together by tightened screws ‚Ä¶ Excessively harsh policies [lead] not to the elimination of corruption but to its growth, not to the evolution of governance but to its degradation.‚Äô The idea that Russia should follow some kind of special way was a fantasy, he said. Russia should look to the example of the Tsar Liberator, Aleksandr II, who had freed the serfs and sought to install ‚Äòa normal, humane order‚Äô, not ‚ÄòNicholas I or Stalin‚Äô ‚Äì a line which many in the audience took to refer to Putin....Medvedev presumably thought the historical allusion sufficiently obscure for Putin to let it pass. But he was venturing onto dangerous ground. Moreover, he had recently lost an important source of insights into the way Putin‚Äôs mind was working.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**Whether for that reason or because Medvedev had grown overconfident, in March he committed a fatal error....The West hailed the Arab Spring as a movement bringing democracy to the region. Putin saw it differently. He agreed that the ousted leaders had brought their troubles on themselves by refusing to recognise the need for change. But no one could foresee what the results of the upheaval would be. ‚ÄòOne cannot simply transfer a familiar template to other regions of the world. We need to let other peoples determine their fate and their future in their own way,‚Äô he said. After Egypt and Tunisia, the Libyan regime was now teetering. If Colonel Gaddafi were overthrown, Putin warned, it might have ‚Äònegative consequences for ‚Ä¶ Europe‚Äô ‚Äì cautionary words which European leaders preferred to forget when Libya became a failed state and 650,000 economic migrants from sub-Saharan Africa poured across its borders to be trafficked by smugglers to Italy...Medvedev shared Putin‚Äôs pessimism. If the North African states disintegrated, he thought, fanatics might come to power, bringing further conflagrations and the rise of extremism.... a coalition of Western countries, led by Britain, France and Italy, joined by Qatar and, later, Turkey, with air support from the United States, launched sustained attacks on Libyan government military formations. It became clear almost at once that it was not an operation to restore peace or even to protect the civilian population, but a coordinated attack led by NATO to overthrow Gaddafi‚Äôs regime, little different from George W. Bush‚Äôs invasion of Iraq, but this time with UN cover. Obama acknowledged later that he had had grave reservations. ‚ÄòWhy Libya and not the Congo, for example, where a series of civil conflicts had resulted in millions of civilian deaths?‚Äô he asked. He left the question unanswered. Libya was a small, oil-rich Arab state, strategically placed across the Mediterranean from Southern Europe. The Congo was neither oil rich nor strategically located. As in most wars of choice, the moral justification for intervention cloaked a decision taken for political reasons.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**Putin, who was visiting the Soviet Far East when the assault began, was furious with Medvedev for not using Russia‚Äôs veto. The UN resolution, he said, was ‚Äòdefective and flawed ‚Ä¶ It allows them to do what they like, to undertake any manner of actions against a sovereign state. It reminds me of a medieval crusade.‚Äô The West used force in international affairs with no thought for the consequences. America had done so in the Balkans, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, ‚Äòand now it‚Äôs Libya‚Äôs turn‚Äô....He was careful to add that he was merely giving his ‚Äòpersonal opinion‚Äô, leaving the door open for Medvedev to accuse NATO of having gone beyond its UN mandate, as was indeed the case. Instead the President dug himself deeper into the hole he had made for himself. He had personally ordered the Foreign Ministry not to veto the resolution, he said. ‚ÄòIt is entirely unacceptable,‚Äô he went on, ‚Äòto use expressions which indicate a clash of civilisations. The word, ‚Äúcrusade‚Äù, for instance. We must all remember that such language could make the situation even worse.' It was a direct rebuttal of everything Putin had said....The state-owned television channels, which had been prominently featuring Putin‚Äôs remarks, were at a loss to know what to do. It had never happened before that the President and the Prime Minister had directly contradicted each other. Eventually word came from Putin‚Äôs aides that, since the President was responsible for foreign affairs, ‚ÄòPrime Minister Putin‚Äôs statement should be forgotten‚Äô. That evening, only Medvedev‚Äôs comment was broadcast....It looked as though he had come out on top. In fact, he had committed political suicide. Had Medvedev dissociated himself from the decision to abstain, Putin might conceivably have pardoned his misjudgement. Doubling down on it sealed his fate. Nothing more was said publicly, but in private, Putin was quoted as saying: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry ‚Ä¶ Come September, we‚Äôll do what we have to do and everyone will breathe a sigh of relief.‚Äô.**."*

A commentator on Ekho Moskvy mocked him as ‚Äòjust an adjective that goes with the noun, Putin‚Äô. Medvedev was blamed for being soft on terror after bomb attacks in Moscow and St Petersburg killed more than a hundred people and injured several hundred more. During Putin‚Äôs second term, there had been no large-scale attacks.

That appears implausible. But it fed into a narrative, widely accepted in the West, that Putin was terrified that something similar might one day happen to him. In fact, his outrage, while real, had a different purpose. He emphasised Gaddafi‚Äôs sordid end ‚Äì ‚Äòhorrible and repulsive scenes of [his] murder, with footage of his bloody body broadcast all over the world‚Äô ‚Äì in order to pin the responsibility more firmly on the United States, whose special forces, he claimed ‚Äì falsely ‚Äì had been present at his death....The United States had shown itself once again ‚Äì at least in Putin‚Äôs mind ‚Äì to be ruthless and untrustworthy. To justify invading Iraq, a Republican administration under George W. Bush had promoted a fabricated story about non-existent weapons of mass destruction.

What was on the internet was beyond the government‚Äôs control. This was a conscious decision on Putin‚Äôs part. Like the freedom allowed to Russian newspapers and privately owned radio stations, it was thought to be a necessary safety valve. Chinese-style censorship would be ‚Äòtechnologically difficult and wrong politically‚Äô, he said. But the result was that the social media networks, which had had little influence a few years earlier, now gave the regime‚Äôs critics a means of organising that the Kremlin had not had to deal with before....'the bar of public expectations has risen.' The nascent middle classes, especially in Moscow and St Petersburg, wanted to see the country become a modern, democratic state, where people‚Äôs rights were protected and the rule of law applied....The middle class had become disenchanted.

The very people who had benefitted most from his regime ‚Äì the up-and-coming middle classes who lived so much better than their parents could have dreamed of, who dressed like their peers in Western Europe, who bought their groceries in supermarkets no different from those in London or Paris and went on holiday to Turkey or Cyprus ‚Äì these were the people who had now turned against him. And not only in Moscow: tens of thousands turned out for protest rallies in St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Rostov-na-Donu and other large provincial cities. As Kudrin noted, these were people who valued stability and had a lot to lose. But the way the Kremlin had played fast and loose with the rules, falsifying the elections, was more than they were prepared to accept.....Putin was uncertain how to react, and it showed....His first instinct was to sneer, just as he had sneered that the murdered Anatoly Litvinenko was ‚Äòunfortunately‚Äô not Lazarus and that Anna Politkovskaya had had virtually no influence in Russia until she was killed. The white ribbons which the protesters wore looked like condoms, he said. The students who took part had been paid to attend. The organisers were trying to destabilise Russia, in the same way that the Orange Revolution had destabilised Ukraine. He gave the impression of flailing about, trying to find a convincing explanation for something that had not been supposed to happen. But at another level he evidently recognised that he had to reach out to the protesters. He was still far and away the most popular leader in Russia and the demonstrators were a tiny minority, less than one per cent of the population as a whole. However, they were an important part, they had numerous sympathisers and there was a danger that the unrest could spread. By 2011, one in four Russians identified themselves as middle class....Accordingly, in his annual phone-in the following week, he went out of his way to sound conciliatory, insisting that people had the right to speak out, ‚Äòso long as they abide by the law‚Äô. Many of the young protesters, he said, had made their case ‚Äòin a clear and lucid manner ‚Ä¶ If this is the result of ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs rule‚Äù, it‚Äôs all to the good ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm truly pleased that we have such people in our country now.‚Äô Discontent was normal, he added, especially at a time of economic recession.**."*

We are a nation of winners, it‚Äôs in our genetic code.‚Äô As if to counter the fiery oratory of Navalny, he abandoned his usual reserve and tried to build an emotional bond with the crowd. ‚ÄòDo we love Russia?‚Äô he asked. ‚ÄòWill we win? ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll ask you again: Do we love Russia?‚Äô The assembled multitude, many of whom had been bussed in by their employers, dutifully responded: ‚ÄòYes!‚Äô But it did not come naturally and fell rather flat.

Russia was gearing up for the Winter Olympics, which were to be held in Sochi in February 2014. Relations with the West were testy. Putin wanted to avoid any repetition of what had happened to the Soviet Union in 1980, when the United States and most of its allies had boycotted the Moscow Olympics in protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Freeing Navalny was a goodwill gesture to those concerned about human rights in Russia. But that was merely the prelude. An even bigger surprise would follow. The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, was to stand for re-election that autumn. Putin had decided that Navalny would be allowed to stand against him. Holding a genuinely competitive election in Moscow, he thought, would show that, despite the crackdown on protest demonstrations and NGOs, Russia was much more democratic than it was given credit for. On the President‚Äôs instructions, Sobyanin worked behind the scenes to ensure that Navalny obtained the requisite number of signatures to take part and, on the last day before the lists closed, he was registered as a candidate.**."*

The mayoral elections in Moscow in September 2013, were the freest in Russia for 20 years.39 Nor was it an isolated case....Other conciliatory gestures followed, also with the Olympics in view. In October, the Constitutional Court ruled that a criminal conviction would no longer entail a lifetime ban on standing for public office. Navalny‚Äôs five-year suspended prison term, if confirmed on appeal, would therefore disqualify him from taking part in the presidential election in 2018 but afterwards, in theory, his ineligibility would end...Putin announced that he would pardon the former oligarch, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who by then had spent more than ten years in prison.

Fifteen years earlier, the Goodwill Games in St Petersburg, even with the limited means then available, had opened the eyes of Western visitors to the new Russia emerging under Yeltsin. The Beijing Olympics, a decade and a half later, with a television audience of hundreds of millions, had transformed China‚Äôs image internationally.

The country‚Äôs role in the break-up of the Soviet Union; the status of Crimea; squabbles over the lease of port facilities at Sevastopol for Russia‚Äôs Black Sea fleet, arguments over the demarcation of the two countries‚Äô borders; disputes over culture, language, history and even between rival branches of the Orthodox Church ‚Äì all ensured that Ukraine would be Russia‚Äôs prickliest partner, no matter who was in power in Moscow or in Kyiv. The Orange Revolution had been a nightmare for Putin, who continued to have great difficulty navigating the country‚Äôs constantly shifting political alliances. Nevertheless, after returning to the presidency in 2012, he decided to make one more attempt to bring Ukraine back into the Russian fold where he was convinced it rightly belonged....One of Putin‚Äôs key priorities ‚Äì ‚Äòthe core of our foreign policy and our strategic objective‚Äô, as he put it ‚Äì was to strengthen integration among the post-Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States. This was in part to compensate for Russia‚Äôs deteriorating relationship with the West. The three largest CIS states, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, together with Belarus, had signed a treaty ten years earlier to set up a Common Economic Space as the nucleus of a future Eurasian Economic Union, which Putin envisaged as a Russian-led alternative to the EU. But after the Orange Revolution, the next step, the establishment of a Customs Union, had stalled. Putin argued that going ahead with the union would create a powerful economic bloc of 210 million people, which would be in all their interests.56 Viktor Yanukovych, now back as Ukraine‚Äôs President, was torn. In March 2012, he had initialled an Association Agreement with the European Union, a possible first step to eventual EU membership. But the European Commission insisted that, before it could be signed, Kyiv would have to take significant steps to reduce corruption, strengthen democracy and improve the rule of law. Yanukovych, who was corrupt to the core, realised that that might be difficult....At this point, it might still have been possible to find a compromise. But Russia‚Äôs attitude to the EU had changed. Initially Putin had seen it as a positive force, an independent power centre which, unlike NATO, was not always condemned to follow America‚Äôs lead....But gradually the relationship had soured. By the time that Ukraine‚Äôs Association Agreement came under discussion, Putin was starting to regard the EU as a stalking horse for NATO. He told Angela Merkel: ‚ÄòWhen I look at the membership of the EU and I look at the membership of NATO, I see basically the same thing.

For anyone with a knowledge of history, this was not difficult to foresee.'...Putin had made clear at Bucharest that any move towards Ukrainian membership of NATO would have grave consequences. The Georgian war had been a warning, and had been intended as such, of how Russia was likely to react if that were ever to happen. The Europeans insisted that the EU was quite separate from NATO and blithely assumed that Ukraine‚Äôs association would not pose any particular problem. It was not merely short-sighted, it was wilfully blind....The Americans were equally blinkered. Vice President Joe Biden, whom Obama had put in charge of Ukrainian matters, had immense experience of American politics but knew little of the sensitivities at work in Kyiv and Moscow.....For all the high-minded talk out of Washington about promoting human rights and freedoms, neither the United States nor Russia had any real concern for Ukrainian interests and it was hypocritical to pretend otherwise.

In December 2017, when the Electoral Commission confirmed that he would not be allowed to run, he called on his supporters to boycott the election. But nationally they accounted for only about five per cent of the electorate75 and since they would not have voted for Putin anyway, it made little different to the outcome.**."*

    -  Chapter 18 "The Endgame" - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**Many Russians were tired of Putin, but even more found it hard to imagine anyone else in charge. Rather, there was a deepening sense of ennui, of drift, of being stuck in a rut, which recalled the stagnation that had marked Brezhnev‚Äôs final years....There were important differences. The Brezhnev era had signalled ineluctable decline with little hope that anything would change for the better. The boredom that marked the start of Putin‚Äôs fourth term was not hopeless. But more and more Russians started to feel that change would not come until, and unless, he decided to step down. Putin liked to claim that he had been thinking about an eventual successor from the day he first took office. He certainly found himself from the outset having to answer questions about his long-term intentions. In May 2000, only ten days after his inauguration, he told an interviewer: ‚ÄòI am not going to be here forever ‚Ä¶ Sooner or later, we all leave our posts.‚Äô The following year he said that he always thought twice before taking decisions, because the day would come when, as an ordinary citizen, ‚Äòyou will be confronted with what you have done.‚ÄôIn 2003, he reflected anew. ‚ÄòWhen a person stays in power too long, no matter how good he is, his drive is blunted, he doesn‚Äôt have the same ‚Äúfire in his belly‚Äù as at the start of the journey. And secondly, he comes to be surrounded by [a] sort of ‚Ä¶ camarilla.‚Äô**."*

    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**A dual power structure, in which he continued to exercise authority after ostensibly stepping down, would be ‚Äòabsolutely ruinous for Russia‚Äô.

    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**In the chaos of the 1990s, Russia‚Äôs birth rate had collapsed, producing a demographic black hole a generation later. Not only would far fewer young people enter the labour market from 2015 to 2025, but the number of women of child-bearing age was expected to fall by a third, producing a knock-on effect which would continue for decades after. As the economy had improved, the birth rate had increased, the death rate had fallen and life expectancy had risen to 68 years for men and 78 for women, not far behind the United States. But the hole in the pension fund kept stubbornly growing......As Putin tried to explain, male life expectancy in Russia was lower than in Western Europe because there was a higher death rate among younger men due to alcoholism and drugs, accidents and a rickety health system. Men who reached the age of 65 were likely to live, on average, another 14 years, only four years less than the OECD average......Putin himself had admitted a few months earlier that the state could have continued to finance the Pension Fund deficit for ‚Äòanother seven to ten years‚Äô before the strain became intolerable. In that case, why was it so essential to act in 2018? ...Officially the government was being far-sighted, biting the bullet early and taking a difficult choice for the common good....wondered if Putin was not ‚Äòdoing his potential chosen successor a favour by taking the heat for an extremely unpopular but necessary move**."*
    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**The word ‚Äòconsecutive‚Äô, in the clause stating that the President should not serve ‚Äòmore than two consecutive terms‚Äô, might be removed, he suggested. He himself would not be affected because the change would apply only from the time it was enacted. But it would mean that, after he stepped down, future presidents would be limited to two six-year terms....It was the first clue that the constitutional changes under discussion were being made with the post-Putin period in mind....Putin put forward additional proposals. The President, he said, should have the right to dismiss federal and Supreme Court judges. The Russian constitution should take precedence over international law, which would mean that Russians could no longer appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. No one could stand as a candidate for the presidency if they had ever held foreign citizenship or a foreign residency permit, which would bar √©migr√©s like Mikhail Khodorkovsky...Since most of this was of scant interest to the Russian man or woman in the street, three further provisions were added to ensure that, when the time came to ask them to approve the reforms, people would come out and vote. The minimum wage would be guaranteed by the constitution at not less than subsistence level; pensions would be indexed for inflation; and marriage was reaffirmed as the traditional union of one man and one woman**."*

He had digitised tax collection, using state-of-the-art software to allow real-time oversight, reducing evasion on VAT payments from 20 per cent to almost nothing. The Financial Times had called him ‚Äòthe tax man of the future‚Äô...The implication was that the new Prime Minister was his personal prot√©g√© and it was noted afterwards that, unlike earlier incumbents, Mishustin was given a virtually free hand to select his cabinet....The time had come, Putin said, ‚Äòto train a new generation of managers, who will be able to take responsibility for Russia'**."*

Much of the Russian press thought the same...That was a misreading....As Putin himself later acknowledged, the primary purpose of the amendment had not been to prolong his time in power ‚Äì although that remained a possibility ‚Äì but to prevent him becoming a lame duck. Without it, the remaining four years of his term would have been consumed by factional intrigues among the political elite, jockeying for the succession, and speculation about what role, if any, Putin would play after stepping down. The moment he was able to stand again, what would happen in 2024 ceased to be an issue and the problem disappeared.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**In October 2019, Aleksei Navalny‚Äôs Anti-Corruption Foundation was declared a foreign agent. Navalny had come up with a new tactic, which he called ‚Äòsmart voting‚Äô. If no ‚Äònon-system‚Äô candidate was allowed to stand, his supporters would vote for whoever had the best chance of defeating the candidate of United Russia, Putin‚Äôs party.....The combination of ‚Äòsmart voting‚Äô and the steady drip of sensational expos√©s of corruption by highly placed officials exasperated Putin. Sometime towards the end of 2019 or early in 2020, he decided that, one way or another, Navalny would have to go....The following summer, the opposition leader travelled across Russia, mobilising his supporters for the regional elections which were to take place in September. On the morning of Thursday, August 20, he was in Tomsk, in Siberia, where he boarded a plane of the domestic Russian airline, S7, to fly back to Moscow. Half an hour after take-off, he began to experience a strange feeling which he had difficulty describing ‚Äì not so much pain, he said later, but ‚Äòas if the life were being sucked out of me‚Äô. He managed to walk to the lavatory before collapsing, groaning uncontrollably. The pilot diverted to Omsk and radioed ahead for an ambulance. By the time they landed, Navalny was in a coma. He was later flown to Berlin, where it was found that he had been poisoned with a cholinesterase inhibitor, subsequently identified as a nerve agent of the Novichok group, similar to that used against Sergei Skripal in Salisbury....Navalny remained in a coma for a month. The German doctors said afterwards that the good sense of the ambulance crew at Omsk, who gave him atropine, an anticholinergic drug used as an antidote against certain forms of poisoning, coupled with the quick reaction of the pilot, had almost certainly saved his life....Navalny had been attacked before by FSB agents or people acting on their behalf. This time was different...The complexity of the planning, the number of people involved and the sophistication of the substance used, all indicated that it had been authorised at a very high level. A team of FSB agents had been tracking Navalny‚Äôs movements since the beginning of the year.56 In Tomsk, they had entered his hotel room while he was out and smeared Novichok on articles of clothing. An FSB chemical-weapons specialist had afterwards been sent to recover the contaminated items.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**The question was whether he himself had ordered Navalny killed or whether, given the ‚Äòhands off‚Äô mode in which he had been running Russia since the middle of his third term, the final decision had been taken by siloviki in his inner circle who assumed that he would be only too glad to see his long-time adversary removed....Even among Russians opposed to the regime, many thought the latter was more likely. Yet there are good grounds for thinking that Putin himself took the decision. His antipathy towards Navalny was personal. He refused to utter Navalny‚Äôs name, speaking instead of ‚Äòthe Berlin patient‚Äô, ‚Äòthis person‚Äô or ‚Äòthis gentleman‚Äô.**"*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**But there is another, more compelling, reason to think that Putin personally approved the attack on Navalny. It crossed a line....Many in the United States and Europe are convinced that Putin has been behind every high-profile killing in Russia for the last 20 years....‚ÄúThe problem with that list, to which at least another dozen names could easily be added, was that, with the exception of Litvinenko, none had been killed at Putin‚Äôs behest. In a number of cases, he had been complicit in the cover-up that followed and he bore indirect responsibility by permitting a climate of impunity in which powerful figures could do as they wished. But that was not the same as directly ordering the death of a political opponent....The attempted murder of Navalny was the first time since Stalin‚Äôs day that a Russian ruler had organised the assassination of a rival. It was too strong a taboo to have been broken without Putin‚Äôs authorisation...A few years earlier, Putin had been asked by a group of students whether he believed that the end justified the means. ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòIf you use some appalling means to reach your goal, you actually destroy the very goal you live for.‚Äô Then he paused and added a qualification: ‚ÄòNot always.‚Äô There might be exceptions. The need to eliminate Navalny from the political arena, to clear the way for the Duma elections due the following autumn and for whatever political transition might follow, was evidently in the ‚Äònot always‚Äô category....Putin had been hoping that Navalny would stay in the West, as Khodorkovsky and Berezovsky had done, in which case, as an √©migr√©, his appeal to Russians would fade. Instead, he decided to follow the path traced by Nelson Mandela, hoping that a sojourn in prison would enhance his status and make him the undisputed standard-bearer of all who opposed the regime....The result was a political fight in which neither side gave quarter. When Navalny flew back to Moscow in January 2021, he was arrested on arrival.**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**In February, the suspension of Navalny‚Äôs jail sentence in the Yves Rocher case was revoked and he was sent to a penal colony, 60 miles east of Moscow. Political prisoners were isolated, woken every hour during the night, forbidden eye contact with guards and made to do repetitive, meaningless tasks. After a month, Navalny went on hunger strike in protest against the authorities‚Äô refusal to let him have medical treatment. Three weeks later, on Putin‚Äôs instructions, they backed down. So long as he was in prison, there was nothing to be gained by pushing the situation to extremes. His suspended five-year sentence in the KirovLes case was still pending. As Khodorkovsky had discovered, a prisoner who crossed Putin could be detained for as long as the authorities desired....After Navalny ended his hunger strike, the West largely lost interest. So did most Russians...Despite all he had been through, Navalny remained more a gadfly than a national leader. But he was the only opposition figure with the charisma to bring large crowds of protesters out onto the streets and he had the potential to develop into a bigger threat.**."*

    - ‚ùóüìù *"...**Moscow‚Äôs relations with the Biden administration began warily. Putin waited almost six weeks after the November 2020 election, twice as long as even the Chinese, before congratulating Biden on his victory. Four years earlier, he had sent a warm message to Trump the following morning. It was a signal that Russia was in no hurry to seek an accommodation...Asked in mid December how he envisaged relations with the new President, Putin said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ It all depends who makes up his team.‚Äô By then, it had been announced that Anthony Blinken would become Secretary of State with Victoria Nuland as his deputy. In Moscow, both were viewed as Russia hawks...Biden was asked whether he thought Putin was a killer. ‚ÄòI do,‚Äô he replied. It was a way to underline his difference from Trump, who, when asked the same question, had answered: ‚ÄòThere are a lot of killers ‚Ä¶ You think our country is so innocent?‚Äô ‚Äì an acknowledgement of moral equivalence which had infuriated many Americans. Biden went on to recall that, when he had met Putin as Vice President, ten years earlier, he had referred to George W. Bush‚Äôs much maligned remark about having looked into Putin‚Äôs eyes and ‚Äògot a sense of his soul‚Äô. Biden said he had told him: ‚ÄòWhen I look into your eyes, I don‚Äôt think you have a soul.‚Äô Putin, he said, had responded: ‚ÄòWe understand each other.'**."*
    - ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüìù *"...**In reality, behind the macho rhetoric and public grandstanding, the relationship had got off to a much less rocky start than it had been made to appear. Four days after Biden‚Äôs inauguration, on January 25, 2021, the two countries had agreed to a five-year extension of New START, the only arms control agreement still in force after the cascade of unilateral American withdrawals during the George W. Bush and Trump presidencies. For the Russians, and for America, that was of vital importance. The following day Biden had telephoned Putin, and although they spent much of their time rehearsing their disagreements, the fact that he had taken the initiative was seen in Moscow as a positive sign. In March, when the White House finally got round to imposing sanctions on Russia for Navalny‚Äôs poisoning, they were the strict minimum. Two months later, Biden announced that the United States would waive threatened countermeasures against companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, a project which had been fiercely opposed by both the Obama and Trump administrations. It was made clear that the United States had not abandoned its reservations but that it would ‚Äúno longer try to enforce them.**."*

He hoped, he added, that there would be no more ‚Äòknee-jerk reactions‚Äô and that relations from now on would be based on ‚Äòdefined rules of engagement‚Äô....Another telling clue to his attitude came when he was asked whether it was true that Biden had once told him that he had no soul. Putin was nothing if not thorough. He had certainly reviewed the transcript of their March 2011 conversation and knew exactly what had been said. But instead of giving a straight answer, he played with the question like a cat with a mouse. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòOne has to think what a soul is. To be honest with you, I just don‚Äôt remember that particular bit of the conversation ‚Ä¶ There must be something wrong with my memory.‚Äô It read like a coded message: ‚ÄòI know exactly what was said, but I won‚Äôt let on. It will remain between us. On that basis, if you wish, we can do business together.'**."*

By April, it became clear that it was the biggest concentration of Russian ground troops in the area since 2015. Russian officials, including Dmitry Kozak, the deputy head of the Presidential Administration who had taken over responsibility for Ukraine from Vladislav Surkov, began issuing ominous warnings that Moscow would not stand idly by if Kyiv moved against the separatists in the Donbas....The consensus in Western chancelleries was that it was essentially Russian muscle-flexing. The fact that the build-up had been carried out so openly suggested that the Kremlin‚Äôs goal was to get the Americans‚Äô attention, rather than to prepare an invasion. But no one could be sure.**."*

Each side set out its red lines: for the United States, an end to Russian election interference; for Russia, no move by NATO to extend its influence further to the East. It was agreed that the two ambassadors should return to their posts and that a ‚ÄòStrategic Stability Dialogue‚Äô should begin at ministerial level to ‚Äòlay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures‚Äô....Journalists on both sides wrote of a return to the way relations had been conducted during the Cold War, when Moscow and Washington had kept national security matters separate from other issues.

Under Biden, the United States had started to take seriously Russian concerns which until then it had refused to discuss, notably in the field of arms control. Moscow‚Äôs relations with China were stronger that they had ever been. In the Middle East, in Africa and the Arctic, Russia had reasserted itself as a power the United States had to reckon with. In Western Europe, Ukraine fatigue had set in. The main European powers ‚Äì France, Germany, Italy and Spain ‚Äì were reluctant to see their ties with Russia held indefinitely hostage to Crimea and the situation in the Donbas, and were open to discreet moves towards a more normal relationship. Britain was an outlier......But since leaving the European Union, London‚Äôs usefulness to America and its importance to Moscow had diminished.

But it did not prevent Ukrainian territory becoming, for all practical purposes, an extension of the Western alliance. For Putin, that situation was untenable. Less than a week after his meeting with Biden, the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, keen to show that post-Brexit Britain was still a force to be reckoned with, sent a destroyer through Crimean waters to demonstrate the West‚Äôs refusal to recognise Russian sovereignty. 
 hat would the West have done, Putin mused afterwards, if Russia had sunk the British ship? Not much, he thought. No one would risk all-out war, because such a war could not be won....At the time, the prospect of a wider conflict over Ukraine appeared remote. Yet here was Putin saying that, were one to occur, the West would be unable to respond militarily for fear of provoking a nuclear riposte....Three weeks later, he published a long article entitled, ‚ÄòOn the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians‚Äô. Much of it restated well-worn themes. Ukrainians and Russians were in reality one people; Ukrainians‚Äô sense of national identity stemmed mainly from the errors of the Bolsheviks, who, by introducing a federal system, had ‚Äòchopped Russia into pieces‚Äô; the West was now exploiting this ‚Äòto undermine our unity‚Äô ‚Äì and more in the same vein. But Putin then went on to deliver a message which went significantly further than anything he had said before. Ukraine, he declared, had become ‚Äòa willing hostage to someone else‚Äôs geopolitical will‚Äô. It was being turned into a ‚Äòspringboard against Russia‚Äô, an ‚Äòaggressive state‚Äô whose armed forces were supervised by Western advisers and whose territory was being used for the deployment of NATO infrastructure.

Had Trump remained in office, Putin might well have been more cautious. Trump was already undermining NATO without Moscow‚Äôs help. Moreover, he was unpredictable and, for all his vaunted admiration of Putin, was capable, if challenged, of lashing out recklessly with disastrous consequences. Biden was a much steadier pair of hands. Ukraine was a useful pressure point, as had been shown by the administration‚Äôs decision to hold early talks in Geneva. Putin‚Äôs takeaway from that meeting had been that America would seek to avoid needless conflict with Russia. The challenge of the future was China; Russia was not exactly a distraction but it was no longer America‚Äôs main foe. If a different president were elected in 2024, that might change....As Putin weighed his options that summer, there appeared to be a window of opportunity for one last push to bring Ukraine to heel. It would be a gamble. But if he could carry it off, correcting what he viewed as one of the cardinal sins of his predecessors, it would be the crowning achievement of his career ‚Äì the last box to check before embarking on a political transition at home, allowing him to leave office on a high note.**."*

The Biden administration began warning publicly of the likelihood of a Russian invasion and promised that, if that happened, it would arm Ukrainian insurgents to turn the country into a ‚Äòporcupine‚Äô which Moscow would be unable to swallow. However the US President also said that he would not send troops to defend Ukraine since it was not a NATO member....But to Putin it confirmed that his instincts had been correct. There would be no risk of direct Western military intervention. At most, NATO would provide weapons and encourage the Ukrainians to fight Russia in its stead. There would be economic sanctions, too, but the Kremlin had been living with sanctions for eight years, ever since the annexation of Crimea.....In a joint communiqu√©, he and Xi Jinping called for an end to NATO expansion and declared that their countries‚Äô friendship had ‚Äòno limit'.**"*

    - üåéüìå *"....**Two days later, at dawn on February 24, Putin announced the invasion...Russia had no choice but to defend itself, he said, because ‚Äòirresponsible Western politicians‚Äô had ‚Äòrudely and unceremoniously‚Äô pushed NATO‚Äôs military infrastructure up to its borders: 'Where did this insolent manner of talking down to us from the height of their exceptionalism ‚Ä¶ come from? What is the explanation for their contemptuous, disdainful attitude? ‚Ä¶ The answer is simple ‚Ä¶ In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union grew weaker and subsequently broke apart. [In the West] there was a state of euphoria, a feeling of absolute superiority ‚Ä¶ They deceived us, or, to put it simply, they duped us [like] a con artist ‚Ä¶ The whole so-called Western bloc, formed by the United States in its own image, is ‚Ä¶ an ‚Äòempire of lies‚Äô.'**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**In the West and in Russia, the war was met with disbelief. Most Europeans ‚Äì and much of the Russian intelligentsia ‚Äì thought Putin had taken leave of his senses. There was speculation that his long isolation during the pandemic had affected his judgement.....The theatricality was a giveaway. It was Putin‚Äôs version of Richard Nixon‚Äôs ‚Äòmadman‚Äô theory, intended to make him appear so irrational and unpredictable that adversaries would hesitate before testing his resolve. To ram the message home, he warned that any attempt to intervene would bring ‚Äòconsequences such as you have never seen in your entire history‚Äô and announced that Russia‚Äôs nuclear forces had been placed on full alert. That turned out to be untrue: the Americans said later there had been no change in Russia‚Äôs nuclear force posture. Stripped of the angry rhetoric, it was typical of the way Putin operated. Almost everyone had been blindsided. The United States, which was monitoring Russian military communications, had concluded, correctly, that an invasion was being planned.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Everyone else, including European governments as well as most Russians, had assumed that he was bluffing ‚Äì which was why, in the days immediately following, some of Russia‚Äôs richest men, including members of Putin‚Äôs entourage, found their assets sequestrated and their mega-yachts impounded in European ports. To them, the idea that Russia would launch a full-scale land war against Ukraine had seemed unthinkable. To Putin, it made perfect sense. For centuries in Europe, war had been an extension of diplomacy. After World War II, Europeans had assumed a little too readily that all that was behind them........Russia‚Äôs use of force, he thought, was different. It was justified because it was the only way to make the United States take Moscow‚Äôs concerns seriously.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Western governments and their advisers struggled to understand Putin‚Äôs reasoning....thought it was ‚Äòessentially a post-colonial land grab‚Äô. But Russia already had more territory than it knew what to do with. Grabbing more land for its own sake served no purpose. The State Department insisted that the war had nothing to do with NATO enlargement and everything to do with Putin‚Äôs refusal to accept Ukraine‚Äôs existence as an independent state, which may have been good spin but was poor history...Others speculated that Putin was unable to stomach the thought of a democratic government in Kyiv which might lead Russians to reject his own, autocratic form of rule. But that was tantamount to saying that all that prevented Russia from becoming a Western-style democracy was Putin and the kleptocrats supporting him. Much as the West might wish that to be true, it was not the case..**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**The decision to invade, far from being aberrant, was consistent with the way he had acted before. Throughout Putin‚Äôs time in office, whenever he was faced with what he saw as an existential choice between antagonising the West and preserving his own power and Russia‚Äôs position in the world, the latter always prevailed. In 2003, he had ordered the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky because nipping in the bud the political ambitions of the business elite was more important than the loss of Western investment. In 2014, he occupied Crimea and backed the creation of rump protectorates in Donetsk and Luhansk because safeguarding the Black Sea Fleet‚Äôs base at Sevastopol and keeping Ukraine out of NATO were more important than Western sanctions. In each case, Putin accepted the economic damage to Russia as a price that had to be paid...In 2022, the invasion of Ukraine followed the same pattern.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Even the Pentagon believed that Kyiv would fall in a matter of days. Putin assumed that Zelensky would then flee, the Kremlin would be able to install a puppet government and Ukraine would be politically and militarily neutralised...But that was not the only goal. In addition to returning Ukraine to Moscow‚Äôs sphere of influence, Putin wanted to show that the United States was powerless to prevent it....As the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, put it: ‚ÄòThis is not actually, or at least, not primarily, about Ukraine at all ‚Ä¶ It reflects the battle over what the [future] world order will look like. Will it be a world in which the West will lead everyone with impunity and without question or will it be something different?'....Putin believed that if Russia succeeded, it would fatally undermine the structures of European security which had been built up under American leadership since the end of the Cold War....but it gave pause to leaders in Eastern Europe. Would America really risk nuclear annihilation to defend Warsaw or Tallinn? The question was not new but the invasion of Ukraine put it in a harshly different light. To Putin, even if Russia had failed to prevent NATO enlargement, it might yet sow doubt about the alliance‚Äôs reliability, undermining faith in America‚Äôs support for other states on Russia‚Äôs borders, NATO members or not.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**America‚Äôs goal, said the National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, was ‚Äòa free and independent Ukraine, a weakened and isolated Russia and a stronger, more unified West‚Äô...The West was returning to the old policies of containment that it had practised during the Cold War, but this time with a more radical objective: not merely to contain Russia but to leave it so diminished that it could never threaten its neighbours again.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**No war works out as planned and Putin‚Äôs was no exception...They had known from their experience in the Donbas over the previous eight years that the Ukrainian army would fight back. But they had not anticipated such fierce resistance. The US, Britain and Canada had been training Ukrainian forces since 2015 for just this kind of eventuality and it showed...Instead of remaining passive, Ukrainians of all ages volunteered to join home defence detachments. Others acted as scouts and sent back information on the Russians‚Äô positions. President Zelensky, far from fleeing the country as Putin had expected, proved an inspirational wartime leader. The close ties between the two peoples ‚Äì more than 40 per cent of Ukrainians have relatives in Russia131 ‚Äì also played a part, though not in the sense that Moscow had hoped. The conflict was fratricidal ‚Äì not quite a civil war, but close ‚Äì with all the emotional intensity that characterises such conflicts. In the regions bearing the brunt of the fighting, bordering the Donbas in eastern and south-eastern Ukraine, which before the war had been largely sympathetic to Russia, much of the population went over to supporting Kyiv.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Putin‚Äôs biggest mistake was his refusal to accept that Ukrainians and Russians, although closely related, are not one people but distinct Slav nations, each of which cleaves to its own national identity. His second, scarcely less serious, miscalculation was to overestimate the capabilities of his armed forces....Initially the Russian forces were under strict orders to spare the civilian population, which led to bizarre scenes as miles-long Russian armoured columns halted at traffic lights to allow Ukrainian motorists to pass....As Ukrainian resistance intensified, the local population became the enemy.....The atrocities that marked the opening months of the war were not on the same scale as in Yugoslavia, where, thirty years earlier, 150,000 people had been killed, many of them dying in spasms of ethnic cleansing that bore the hallmarks of genocide, nor were they as systematic as in Chechnya or Syria. Cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv were not reduced to rubble, as Grozny and Aleppo had been, a degree of restraint which puzzled Western military analysts as well as many Russians, who wondered why their army was being asked to fight ‚Äòwith one hand tied behind its back‚Äô.... Mariupol was an exception because it controlled the land bridge between the Donbas and Crimea and the Russians were determined to take it no matter what the cost....In Crimea in 2014, the special forces, better equipped and better trained than regular troops, had impressed Western observers by their discipline. But they had met no resistance. Eight years later, the war in Ukraine showed that, despite a modernisation programme costing billions of dollars, the Russian army was still a blunt instrument, parts of which would revert to savagery when faced with serious opposition.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**In the first two-and-a-half months, the Russian expeditionary force was said to have lost up to 15,000 soldiers killed and perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 wounded ‚Äì more than all the American casualties in 20 years‚Äô fighting in Afghanistan. Thousands of Ukrainians died, a quarter of the population was displaced and more than five million fled the country as refugees....Ukraine writhed in torment but fought back...The West responded not with half-measures as in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea but by pouring in arms supplies and imposing unprecedented economic sanctions.**"*
    - üåéüìå *"....**In the West, there was a broad consensus that Putin had made a fatal error. The progress of the war seemed to confirm that. After six weeks, the Russians withdrew from Kyiv, apparently abandoning hopes of regime change and regrouping for the more limited objective of securing the Donbas and the land bridge to Crimea....President Zelensky, who, earlier in the conflict, had proposed, in return for a peace agreement, Ukrainian neutrality and an end to the country‚Äôs NATO ambitions, now pledged never to give up an inch of Ukrainian territory and spoke of driving out the Russians altogether...However the situation was more complicated than those optimistic readouts made it appear...British and American commentators initially sought to portray the conflict as ‚Äòthe world against Russia‚Äô. It soon became clear that in fact it was ‚Äòthe West against Russia‚Äô. Among the ten largest countries, only one ‚Äì the United States ‚Äì unequivocally supported Ukraine. The others, representing between them more than half the world‚Äôs population, either supported Moscow or sat on the fence...Had the Biden administration focused on the violation of Ukraine‚Äôs territorial integrity ‚Äì a principle on which all countries could agree ‚Äì the tally might have been different. By framing it as a struggle between democracy and autocracy, the White House rebuffed countries with autocratic regimes which might otherwise have been supportive.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Even within NATO, where at first sight the war created a renewed sense of unity and common purpose and Finland and Sweden announced that they envisaged membership, there were fissures beneath the surface. ‚ÄòOld Europe‚Äô and ‚ÄòNew Europe‚Äô, as Donald Rumsfeld had called them, had very different agendas. Poland, the Baltic States, the Czech Republic and Slovakia took a maximalist position, holding that Russia only understood the language of force and Europe would not be safe until it had been decisively defeated. Britain played the role of cheerleader. France, Germany, Italy and Spain looked more soberly to the day when peace would be restored and relations would have somehow to be repaired.....Producing fractures of this kind, globally and within Europe, had been one of Putin‚Äôs aims. As the economic fallout from the conflict mounted, such divisions, he thought, would become more pronounced. How would Europeans react, Russian officials gloated, when faced with sharply higher inflation, shortages of energy and basic foodstuffs? How long would Europe‚Äôs welcome last if millions of Ukrainian refugees stayed on indefinitely? What would happen if hunger in Africa and the Middle East brought fresh waves of migrants towards Europe‚Äôs shores? When the war eventually ended, who would pay the half trillion US dollars or more that Ukraine‚Äôs reconstruction would need?**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**If Western leaders had hoped that economic pressure would turn Russians against Putin‚Äôs regime, they were disappointed. Sanctions are a double-edged sword. In the first months, most Russians saw little change in their everyday lives. The rich resigned themselves to holidaying in Dubai rather than on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur. The poor had their income protected by government subsidies. The rouble kept its value. The Russian economy did not collapse. Everyone understood that more difficult times lay ahead. One leading Russian economist described the state support measures as ‚Äòputting cosmetics on a corpse‚Äô. But sanctions reinforced the Kremlin‚Äôs narrative that the West was determined to bring Russia to its knees and every patriotic citizen was duty bound to resist. Private Western initiatives to condemn the Russian invasion had a similar effect. Banning Russian tennis players from Wimbledon, renaming Degas‚Äôs ‚ÄòRussian Dancers‚Äô as ‚ÄòUkrainian Dancers‚Äô, suspending Russian opera singers and cancelling concerts of Russian music, however virtuous such decisions might seem to those responsible, gave Russians the impression that all of them, even those most opposed to their government‚Äôs actions, were irrevocably tarred with collective guilt.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**While the war continued, Putin‚Äôs plans for a transfer of power in Russia were put on hold, to be revived or not, depending on the outcome, once the conflict had played out...However it eventuated, there was a palpable sense that an era had ended. The three decades since the Cold War in which the United States had been the uncontested superpower were over. Beijing was challenging American supremacy in the South China Sea. Russia, with Chinese backing, was contesting American power in Europe. What would follow was uncertain. A new geopolitical reality would emerge, but what form it would take, no one could predict.**."*
    - *Afterword* -  üåéüìå *"....**Anyone, Russian or foreigner, who reflects on Russia‚Äôs situation after more than 20 years of Putin‚Äôs rule, is bound to wonder: Did it have to be this way? Was the drift towards authoritarianism preordained? Were Russia‚Äôs relations with the West fated from the outset to decline into mutual hostility and conflict or could that have been avoided?......Unfortunately, they generate much heat and very little light. Russia today is what it is and its relations with the West are what they are, not what others might wish them to be.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**A common view, especially in the United States but in much of Europe as well, is that ‚ÄòRussia is under the thumb of a brutal dictator no different from the communists‚Äô. Until the war in Ukraine, that was a gross oversimplification. For most Russians, even after the crackdown on the opposition in 2021, life was far less bleak than it was painted in the West. Despite glaring inequalities, living standards had risen across the board. Crony capitalism and corruption were rampant and growth had stalled after the recession of 2008. Nonetheless, the economy had doubled in size under Putin‚Äôs stewardship and the population as a whole lived better than at any time in the past. The share of oil and gas in GDP had been significantly reduced. Agriculture, which Mikhail Gorbachev used to say had been a disaster ever since 1917, was booming. Where in Soviet times, Russia imported food, farm exports were bringing in more money than arms sales.......Since the war in Ukraine, much of that has since changed for the worse. Many of the achievements of Putin‚Äôs first three terms risk being lost. Yet even amid war and economic reprisals by the West, the quality of life for most Russians bears little resemblance to what it was in the early 1990s, let alone under communist rule. The modernisation of Russia‚Äôs armed forces, which had been touted as one of Putin‚Äôs great achievements, has turned out to be far less impressive than had been claimed. Nonetheless, by fair means and foul, Russia has reasserted itself as a major actor in international affairs whose voice cannot be ignored.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**The question is not whether Russia could have taken a different path. It is why Russia ‚Äì and Putin ‚Äì took the path they did and where the country will go from here.The seminal decisions, which have helped to determine Russia‚Äôs course ever since, were taken in the 1990s. The Yeltsin constitution established a presidential republic in which parliament played a secondary role. The privatisation of state-owned industry and natural resources to well-connected insiders at fire-sale prices ‚Äì a programme inspired by the doctrines of the Chicago school and enthusiastically supported by American advisers ‚Äì created an economic base not that different from that built by Henry Ford, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, Rockefeller and Pierpoint Morgan in America a century earlier.....In both cases ‚Äì the creation of a powerful presidency and of an oligarchy detested by the general population as much as the US robber barons ever were ‚Äì Yeltsin and his advisers believed there was no alternative. They may well have been right. But whether right or wrong, those were the choices they made.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**The Clinton administration and its European allies also took two key decisions which had a lasting effect on developments within Russia and on its relations with the West. The first was to hold off from providing large-scale financial aid after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The second was to offer NATO membership to the former Warsaw Pact states of Central and Eastern Europe....To policy-makers in Washington, those choices seemed entirely logical....Yeltsin‚Äôs Russia was so dysfunctional, they argued, that giving Moscow economic aid would amount to pouring it down a black hole. The Russian state had first to get itself in order. Only then could economic assistance make any real difference. Accordingly, the West gave far more aid to Poland, a country with a quarter of Russia‚Äôs population, than it did to Moscow.........In the same way, NATO expansion was seen as necessary to bind the newly liberated Eastern European states to the West and ensure that Russia would never subjugate them again. That, too, can be questioned, but it was what was decided.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Russians saw things very differently......From their perspective, they had abandoned communism, embraced what until then they had disparaged as ‚Äòbourgeois democracy‚Äô, begun the painful transition to a market economy and accepted such un-Russian ideas as individual property ownership and a multiparty political system, yet instead of welcoming them back like the prodigal sons they were, the United States and its allies had kept them at arm‚Äôs length. They felt cheated. America, far from being the role model and strategic partner that they had hoped, seemed bent on keeping Russia down. NATO enlargement was incomprehensible. Russian leaders throughout history had feared invasion from the West. Both Napoleon and Hitler had sent their armies that way. If the West meant well, why was it moving its troops closer and closer to Russia‚Äôs borders?**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Americans could not see that. The Cold War was over, they said. A new era had been born, a new world order in which everyone was on the same side. What was there for Russia to worry about?.....To the Kremlin, that was hypocrisy. Politics the American way had always been a zero-sum game. The Cold War had indeed ended. Russia had lost. The West had won......It is not difficult to make a case that the West, as the stronger partner, bears most of the responsibility for the failure to establish normal relations after the Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse. At a time when Russia was on its knees, many Western leaders, not only in the United States, concluded myopically that it was finished and would never again be a major power. It was for the West to set the rules, they argued. Russian sensitivities could be ignored. Until the Ukraine crisis in 2014 and Putin‚Äôs intervention in Syria, the following year, the United States was proactive, Russia reactive......it launched a democracy promotion campaign to spread its values and political beliefs to Russia and the rest of the world.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**None of that should have been a surprise. The United States was merely doing what great powers always do. Strong countries lay down the law and demand that defeated opponents follow. After World War II, former enemies like Germany and Japan became America‚Äôs allies. Russia was expected to do something similar....For a number of reasons, that did not happen.....Russia was too huge to fit into the Western alliance. It had been the West‚Äôs main adversary for half a century, whereas Germany and Japan had only briefly been America‚Äôs enemies. Unlike the Axis powers, Russia had not been defeated in war and retained a formidable nuclear arsenal. Military establishments do not turn on a dime: deeply entrenched attitudes take generations to change. NATO enlargement was an insurance policy as well as a way to project American power.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**He believed that Russia‚Äôs destiny was as a European state. Culturally, economically and politically, Europe was where it belonged.....George W. Bush welcomed that. But, like Clinton, Bush saw Russia‚Äôs future as part of an American-led world....Putin did not.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**this would always have been a fundamental stumbling block to the establishment of normal ties. In that sense there was an inevitability about the way the relationship developed. It was largely the result of a series of Western, essentially American, decisions. But for the United States to have acted differently would have required an effort of statesmanship and far-sightedness, calling into question basic assumptions about America‚Äôs role in the world, of which no American leader was capable. The chain of cause and effect, starting in the 1990s, that has led to the present state of affairs, could doubtless have taken other forms. But it is unlikely that the end result would have been significantly different, because the historical forces driving it would have remained the same....America, the dominant global power, believes that its role is to lead. Russia refuses to be led....The United States‚Äô belief in its own exceptionalism has not helped. If a nation regards itself as exceptional, it cannot, by definition, accept others as equals. Russia demanded equality and its corollary, respect.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**As relations with the West worsened, pro-Western liberals in Russia were excluded from decision-making.....Liberal democracy has shallow roots in Russia. In some ways, the most remarkable thing about the early 2000s was not that Putin sought to restrict it but that it survived at all. However, the result has been a vicious circle. As relations with the West have deteriorated, the influence of the siloviki and other conservatives has increased, further eroding democratic freedoms and making relations with the West still worse.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**If it is relatively straightforward to see how the present state of affairs in Russia has arisen, it is far harder to describe what may happen next. Anyone who tries to peer into the future, in Russia or anywhere else, is on a hiding to nothing. But history ‚Äì the history which failed to ‚Äòend‚Äô after the Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse but instead came roaring back ‚Äì offers a few clues.....whoever succeeds Putin ‚Äì whether an individual or a collective leadership ‚Äì is unlikely to put Russia on a fundamentally different course, either at home or abroad.......Russians grumble because their expectations are not being met. But the majority have too much to lose to want to risk another tectonic upheaval.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Whatever happens in the short term, within the next 10 to 15 years power will pass to a generation of Russians who grew up after the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Their attitudes and their sense of Russia‚Äôs place in the world are very different from those of their parents‚Äô generation. They will be faced with the tasks that Putin has left undone. His principal achievements have been the reassertion of Russia‚Äôs military power and political cohesion. In the coming decades, Russia‚Äôs international status will depend less on its military and its diplomats and more on the success or failure of its domestic transformation. For his successors, the key challenges will be structural reform, technological innovation and diversification away from oil and gas exports to take account of climate change, which could force a radical reshaping of the Russian economy as early as the 2030s**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**In most countries, foreign policy is driven by domestic considerations, not the other way round. In Russia for most of the past century, the opposite has been true. Under Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev, as well as their successors, Russian domestic policy has been heavily influenced by ties with the West. In the years ahead, the shifting relations between the world‚Äôs ‚ÄòBig Three‚Äô ‚Äì America, China and Russia ‚Äì will be a crucial variable.......sooner or later Xi Jinping‚Äôs China would have sought nuclear parity whatever America did ‚Äì it will alter fundamentally the contours of the great power triangle.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**A shift in American policy to focus on China‚Äôs growing strength will affect the West‚Äôs relations with Russia which in turn will influence Russian domestic policies. It has been a constant of Russian politics for at least the last century that a less adversarial relationship with the West translates into greater freedoms at home.......Other global challenges may also intervene. Apart from climate change, they include greatly increased economic migration and, possibly, a new and deadlier zoonotic pandemic. If any of these were to become critical, the present divisions between the world‚Äôs great powers might become less relevant. As Putin himself put it, ‚Äòin such conditions, geopolitical [and] ideological rivalry loses its meaning‚Äô. It has happened before. During the Second World War, Russia and the Western powers cast aside their political and ideological differences to join forces against the common threat from Nazi Germany........The Covid-19 pandemic, far from promoting unity, exacerbated existing divisions. Even if something of this kind does occur, its effects may well be marginal. But it cannot be ruled out altogether.**."*
    - üåéüìå *"....**Russia is used to playing a long game. Just as Putin is convinced that one day, despite the war, Moscow and Kyiv will overcome their differences, he believes that America and Russia will eventually settle into a less contentious relationship. In the long term, he is no doubt right, the only uncertainty being how long it will take. The maxim that countries have permanent interests, but no permanent friends or enemies, remains as true today as when Lord Palmerston coined it in 1848.....It would be wrong, therefore, to regard the current hostility between Russia and the West as for ever fixed. But in the meantime, Russia will remain an awkward bedfellow. An unimaginably vast country, suspended across the top of the world between Europe and Asia, its history is profoundly different from that of its European cousins, yet its people are formed in exactly the same mould. That is part of the problem. Family quarrels are often the most intractable. Russians not only look like Europeans, they are Europeans and are expected to behave as the rest of the family does. Unaccountably, stubbornly, they refuse to do so. That will not soon change..**."*

The emancipation was the first in a series of reforms in the 1860s, the so-called Great Reforms...One of the problems of the tsarist system was absence of provincial institutions in could entrust to extend its influence and run local government...The judicial reforms set up an independent legal system with public jury trials. There were new laws granting autonomy to universities, expanding primary schooling, relaxing cencorship. Aim was to put society on its feet and let it flex its muscles.

He did not see the need to adapt his rule to the demands of the new world...On Sunday, 9 Jan 1905, a large crowd of workers marched towards the Winter Palace to hand in a petition to the tsar. On his orders, soldiers fired at the crowd. In that moment, the folk myth of tsar-batiushka, an idea that had underpinned the monarchy for centuries, was finally destroyed...On 17 October, he reluctantly agreed to sign a Manifesto, granting freedoms of speech, assembly and religion, establishing a legislative parliament, Duma...Nicholas was increasingly removed from political reality. He was retreating into a fantasy of popular autocracy, such as he imagined had existed in medieval Muscovy. That was why he tolerated Rasputin...Nicholas had become a victim of his regimes's propaganda about people's devotion to him. But that myth had been destroyed on Bloody Sunday."*

    - Chapter 8 "Revolutionary Russia" - *"..It was hard to tell how much of this anger was patriotically motivated and how much based on hatred of the wealthy urban class. The revolutionary mode was nationalist in character...In September 1915, in a desparate attempt to restore morale, Nicholas took over supreme command. He thought that his presence at the front would inspire the soldiers, that if they would not fight for Russia they would surely to do so for their holy tsar. It was a terrible mistake. From this point, Nicholas took the blame for every defeat. To explain the unending sequence of defeats, it was said that he was informing the Kaiser about the movement of his troops. There was no truth in this rumours. But that was not the point. The fact that people were prepared to believe them made them politically dangerous. In a revolutionary crisis it is perceptions and beliefs, not realities, that count. Through their ability to mobilise an opposition and give its protests meaning as a patriotic act, they contributed to the revolutionary mood."*

Leon Trotsky: 'The country had so radically vomited up monarchy that it could never ever crawl down the people's throat again'...But if politically monarchy was dead, it was still alive in a broader sense, in the psychology that made the people so receptive to later Soviet cults of the leader. Misconception: 'We want a democratic republic and a tsar batiushka for three years'."*

He suggested that each town should develop its own means of cleansing the Russian land...collective responsibility, applied now to a whole social class...The soldiers took the decree as a license to demobilise, to carry out the revolution in their towns. Without the army, Bolsheviks are open for peace talks with Germans. They were divided over strategy: Left wing against, it would end all hopes to spread revolution to West.

They were protesting against the loss of rights hard won in 1917."*
    - Chapter 8 - *"It meant abandoning the War Communism and laying the foundations of a New Economic Policy (NEP) in which private trade and small scale manufacturing would be allowed within the socialist system. There were many Bolsheviks who feared that this would lead to the return to the capitalist system. But Lenin insisted that as long as state controls the heavy industry and national resources, there was no danger in allowing private farming. To enforce party unity, Lenin also introduced a ban on factions inside the party. Questioning the decisions could mean expulsion from the party...NEP was to be a tenporary retreat from the utopian dream of building socialism. Lenin told: 'Only in countries with developed capitalism was it possible to make an immediate transition to socialism.' This was what the Mensheviks had said in 1917...Bolsheviks would have to change their ways, if Lenin's vision was to be achieved. They could no longer rule by threating people with rifles. Now, lenin warned, they had to proceed more slowly. They needed Western eduation and culture, to learn how to govern properly."*

Through the Comintern, Russia gained a new position on the international stage. Communisn gave it a new messianic role...By 1924 it had become apparent, however, that a revolution in the West was unlikely. The immediate post-war instability had passed. Now Soviet Union, formed by the Russian, Transcaucasion, Ukrainian and Belarusian, had to become self-sufficient and build industries with capital from its own economy.

It was connected to the obligations of krugovaya poruka, medieval principal of collective responsibility. During the Great Terror, this tradition was reflected."*

    - Chapter 11 - *"The Russians were affected more than other nationalities by the ideological collapse. Others were able to build themselves as nation states by imagining the Soviet collapse as a national liberation from foreign (Russian) rule. But the Russians did not have this possibility. They had never been a nation state. Their identity had been subsumed in the Russian Empire, then in the Soviet Union, where they were regarded as the leading nationality. Russia had existed as an empire for so long that it could not simply reinvent itself as a nation after 1991...New national holidays were established. Those of the Russian church were all restored. Soviet holidays were still observed. The vacuum created by the Soviet collapse was being filled with everybperiod of Russian history."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Putin's view of the country's history is statist and conservative. His reading of it tells him that Russia had been strong when its people are united behind a strong state; weak when the people were divided and lost sigh of Russian principals that united and distinguished them."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"The meaning of sovereign democracy, as Surkov defined it, was that Russia should be free to choose its own political system and call it a democracy. The sovereignty depended on their own belief that the system they now had was the outcome of their history, of every stage of it, and that it was of their own making."*

    - Chapter 11 - *"Putin: As to some problematic pages in our history - yes we've had them. But what state hasn't? And we've had fewer of such pages than some other states. And ours were not as horrible as those of some others. Yes, we have had some terrible pages: let us remember the events beginning in 1937, let us not forget about them. But other countries have had no less, and even more. In any case we did not pour chemicals over thousands of kilometers or drop on a small country seven times more bombs than during the entire WW2, as the US did in Vietnam., for instance. Nor did we have other black pages, such as Nasizm. All sorts of things happen in the history of every state. And we cannot allow ourselves to be saddled with guilt."*

    - Chapter 11 - ***"During his first term in office, Putin looked to further Russia‚Äôs integration with the West. In interviews he spelled out his vision of the country as ‚Äòpart of western European culture‚Äô, and said that he was open to the possibility of Russia joining NATO and the European Union...'We will strive to remain where geography and our spirit have placed us, but if we are pushed out,' Putin warned, 'we will be forced to seek other ties to strengthen ourselves.' It was a recurring pattern running right through Russian history since at least the eighteenth century. Russia wanted to be part of Europe, to be treated with respect. But if it was rejected by the West‚Äôs leaders, or if they humiliated it, Russia would rebuild itself and arm itself against the West...NATO and the EU missed an opportunity to end this historical cycle. Instead of trying to bring Russia into new security arrangements for Europe, NATO kept it isolated. The US and its North Atlantic allies acted as if the Cold War had been ‚Äòwon‚Äô by them, and that Russia, the ‚Äòdefeated‚Äô power, need not be consulted on the consequences of the Soviet collapse in regions where the Russians had historic interests. The effect of Western actions was to reinforce the Russians‚Äô own resentments of the West. On the back of years of anti-Western propaganda during the Cold War it did not take a lot to persuade them that a hostile West refused to recognise their country as an equal and took advantage of its current weakness to diminish it. This was the basis on which Putin built his anti-Western ideology.‚Äù***
    - Chapter 11 - *"The real rupture with the West came with NATO‚Äôs eastward expansion. In the Kremlin‚Äôs thinking it was linked to the spread of US-sponsored democratic movements in its sphere of influence that posed a threat to Russia‚Äôs ‚Äòsovereign democracy‚Äô. In 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were granted NATO membership. Five years later, Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also joined the alliance. **Moscow saw this as a betrayal of a verbal promise made by the Americans on the collapse of the Berlin Wall that NATO would not advance ‚Äòeven one inch to the east‚Äô. Many on the US side denied giving such a guarantee, or argued that it had been meant for eastern Germany, not for all the Warsaw Pact countries**."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Whatever the reality, **NATO‚Äôs eastward expansion poisoned its relations with Russia**. George Kennan, who had shaped the Cold War policy of Soviet containment in 1946, warned that it would be a ‚Äòtragic mistake‚Äô to encroach on the territories ‚Äúbe a ‚Äòtragic mistake‚Äô to encroach on the territories of the former Warsaw Pact. **‚ÄòIt shows so little understanding of Russian history,‚Äô he told the New York Times in 1998. ‚ÄòOf course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then NATO will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are ‚Äì but this is just wrong.‚Äô That indeed is how events turned out..By provoking Russian aggression, NATO had created the very problem it was meant to counteract. It was as if it needed an aggressive Russia to justify its existence**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Putin spoke of the need for Russia to restore its influence in what he called the ‚ÄòRussian world‚Äô (Russkii mir), a concept he attached to the defence of ‚Äòtraditional Russian values‚Äô within the borders of the former Soviet Union. The ‚ÄòRussian world‚Äô idea had been advanced by the patriarch of the Orthodox Church to promote its spiritual inheritance from Kievan Rus, a link broken by the break-up of the Soviet Union. It was seized on by Putin, who used it as an arm of his foreign policy from 2012. The ‚ÄòRussian world‚Äô, he said, was a ‚Äòfamily‚Äô of Slavs, the Russians, the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, who shared a common history, religion and cultural inheritance from Kievan Rus. This world had been torn apart by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ‚Äògreatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century‚Äô, as he had described it in a 2005 address. ‚ÄòAs for the Russian nation,‚Äô he went on, ‚Äòit became a real drama. Tens of millions of our citizens and compatriots found themselves outside the territory of Russia."*

    - Chapter 11 - *"The Slavophiles had argued that Russia should be seen as a ‚Äòspiritual civilisation‚Äô broader than its territorial boundaries. Putin argued that it was the mission of the Russian state to defend the ‚Äòtens of millions of our citizens‚Äô who had been stranded outside Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. ..language served as the president‚Äôs excuse to intervene in former Soviet countries where Russian-speakers formed a large minority. The fact that they were citizens of foreign sovereign states, and identified themselves as such, did not count in Putin‚Äôs view...His thinking here was possibly derived from Danilevsky‚Äôs Russia and Europe, in which the Pan-Slav thinker had maintained that Russia was a distinctive multi-cultural civilisation, neither understood nor recognised by Europe, which saw it only as an aggressor state and wanted to diminish it. Russia was not part of Europe, Danilevsky argued, and should not seek its approval or measure its own progress by its ‚Äòuniversal‚Äô principles, which were in fact self-serving, a means for Europe to impose its values on other civilisations. Following the West could only weaken Russia, which should stand against it if it wanted to defend its own conservative and religious traditions...More than any other country in the world, Ivan Ilyin argued, Russia had a ‚Äòheavy cross to bear‚Äô on account of its harsh climate, its vast land mass to defend and its history of suffering; but it had emerged from these ordeals with a special spiritual strength, a capacity for love and selfless sacrifice, which, if mastered by a ‚Äònational dictator‚Äô, would liberate it from the Bolsheviks and lead to its national renewal as a holy empire in Eurasia."*

    - Chapter 11 - *"**Ukraine soon became the battlefield for this ‚Äòclash of civilisations‚Äô between Russia and the West.** Although the Putin government had many times declared its recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty, it never really came round to accepting it. **In Putin‚Äôs view Ukraine had occupied the borderlands of ‚Äòhistorical‚Äô or ‚Äògreater‚Äô Russia since the times of Kievan Rus. It was an inseparable part of the ‚ÄòRussian world‚Äô.** Too many families, communities, were made up of both Russians and Ukrainians; the economies of the two countries were too integrated to be pulled apart. Russia‚Äôs gas was piped to Europe through Ukraine. Its most important naval base was at Sevastopol in the **Crimea, a mainly Russian territory assigned to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic by Khrushchev in 1954** to mark the tercentenary of Russia‚Äôs union with the Cossack hetmanate. Little significance had been attached to Khrushchev‚Äôs gift. There were no national boundaries in the Soviet Union. **But after 1991 the loss of the Crimea was sorely felt by the Russians**, who had spent their holidays at its resorts and learned at school that it was ‚Äòtheirs‚Äô... **Crimea was the birthplace of Russia‚Äôs Christianity, where Prince Vladimir had been baptised, the symbolic home of the ‚ÄòRussian soul‚Äô** ‚Äì that, at least, was how it was presented by the propagandists of the ‚ÄòRussian world‚Äô."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Putin pursued a policy of keeping Ukraine weak, divided and dependent on Russia. He regarded Russia‚Äôs domination of Ukraine as a necessary measure to prevent its falling under Western influence. He feared Ukraine as a burgeoning democracy whose freedoms were a threat to his own authoritarian regime (the ‚ÄòOrange Revolution‚Äô of 2004‚Äì5, **in which mass protests had reversed the rigged election of the pro-Russian presidential candidate Yanukovich to secure the victory of Viktor Yushchenko, alarmed the Kremlin in particular**). His strategy was reminiscent of tsarist policies towards Russia‚Äôs neighbouring states, especially the Ottoman Empire. The tsars had used their military might as a means of armed diplomacy. By threatening the sultan‚Äôs Balkan territories, and, if necessary, occupying them, they had forced him to concede to their demands in the Black Sea and the Holy Lands. Putin adopted the same tactics in Ukraine. **Instead of the defence of the Orthodox abroad, the pretext used by the tsars to interfere in European Turkey, he invoked the defence of ‚Äòthe millions‚Äô of former Russian citizens to justify his interference in Ukrainian affairs.**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *‚ÄúThe Putin regime backed pro-Russian leaders in Ukraine, and made things hard for those who favoured closer integration with Europe. Divisions in Ukraine played into the Kremlin‚Äôs hands. **There was a historical divide between the western regions, which had been part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and then the Austrian‚ÄìHungarian Empire, where Ukrainian was widely spoken, and the eastern regions of Ukraine, where Russian was the dominant language. Because of the Russian presence in the east, no government could take Ukraine too close to Europe without risking civil war; but the European outlook of the western provinces meant that realigning the country with Russia would be just as dangerous.**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"The delicate balance was upset by two developments. The first was **Putin‚Äôs long-term plan to include Ukraine in a Eurasian Economic Union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, among other countries of the former Soviet Union. Putin envisaged the Eurasian Union one day growing into something like the European Union under Russia‚Äôs leadership ‚Äì a Eurasian bloc to counteract the West.** The second was the outbreak of mass protests in Kiev and other west Ukrainian cities from the autumn of 2013. Occupying Maidan Square in Kiev, the demonstrators called on the Yanukovich government (elected fair and square in the 2010 elections) to sign an Association Agreement with the EU. Yanukovich had negotiated the agreement, only to suspend preparations for it under pressure from Moscow. Shooting at the crowds by unidentified snipers (probably special forces of the Yanukovich government) turned the protests into a revolution, the Maidan Revolution, watched by TV audiences around the world. By 22 February 2014, the protesters had gained control of Kiev. Yanukovich fled to east Ukraine, and later to Russia, while a caretaker government was formed in the Ukrainian parliament."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Seizing on the questionable parallel with Kosovo, where NATO‚Äôs intervention had secured the Albanians‚Äô right to self-determination, the Kremlin launched a new Crimean War to defend what it claimed were the same rights for the Russians of the Crimea...**in which 97 per cent of the people voted for reunion with Russia. Even with a properly conducted plebiscite the same decision would have been reached by a large majority.** But Putin did not need to play by international rules. He knew that NATO would not act to defend Ukrainian territory. Russian might had called its bluff. **The annexation of Crimea was broadly welcomed by the population in Russia. There was a sense that an unjust loss of Russian territory ‚Äì a symbol of the loss of Russia‚Äôs empire and great-power status in the world ‚Äì had been reversed. National pride had been restored.**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Soon after the Crimean invasion Putin sent in military aid to the separatist fighters in the east, later reinforcing them with unbadged Russian troops in a war that rumbled on for the next eight years, claiming 20,000 Russian and Ukrainian lives. The warring parties failed to reach agreement on the Minsk II Accords, a peace plan brokered by the Germans and the French under which Ukraine would regain its sovereignty in the disputed eastern areas, including its control of the border with Russia, while the Donbass would be given full autonomy in a more decentralised Ukraine. All this time the West continued buying Russian fossil fuels. In ‚ÄòLondongrad‚Äô, a safe British haven for the oligarchs, law firms, bankers, tax consultants, art dealers and real estate agents carried on as usual as their money launderers."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"**The Russian economy had adapted to the sanctions and had largely recovered.** Thanks to sales of oil and gas, the country‚Äôs foreign currency reserves had grown to $500 billion, the fourth largest in the world. It gave Putin the war chest he would need to go on fighting in Ukraine while maintaining living standards in Russia. He was not afraid of more sanctions."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"**Putin saw the role of NATO in Ukraine as a direct military threat.** In an hour-long address to the Russian people on 21 February 2022, he claimed that Ukraine would ‚Äòserve as an advanced bridgehead‚Äô for NATO‚Äôs forces to attack Russia unless Moscow intervened. Under the guise of its training missions, NATO, he declared, was building bases in Ukrainian cities like Kharkiv, near the Russian border, from which its nuclear missiles could reach Moscow in a few minutes. **‚ÄòIt is like a knife to our throat,‚Äô he said.** From a Western point of view this seemed mad and paranoid. **NATO, after all, was a defensive alliance and had no reason to attack Russia. But as Putin saw it, it was the conclusion to be drawn from his reading of the history of Russia and Ukraine.**...**He demanded a written guarantee that Ukraine would never become part of NATO.**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Few people thought that he would launch a full-scale invasion...His decision surprised even senior Kremlin officials. **It must be explained by Putin‚Äôs isolation from reality. Terrified of Covid, he had spent the past two years in lockdown on his own in the Kremlin**. After twenty-two years in power, Putin had become an autocrat. No one dared to question him...His spies in Kiev had told him that Zelensky‚Äôs government would soon collapse: it had ruined the economy and lost the support of the Ukrainians, who would welcome Russia‚Äôs troops with open arms. They were too afraid to disillusion him by telling him the truth."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"How will this war end, and what sort of Russia will emerge from it? None of the possible scenarios bodes well for Russia or Ukraine...A military defeat for Russia is the first and least likely possibility...The second possible scenario is a stalemate, a permanently frozen conflict in Ukraine, with Russian troops in the Donbass and the east but neither side prepared to stop the fighting...A Russian victory of some kind is the most likely outcome of this war, given the resources at the Kremlin‚Äôs disposal. But what sort of victory can be achieved? Even if the Russians settle for the whole of the Donbass as their ‚Äòvictory‚Äô, they will still be left with the problem of Ukrainian insurgency and civil disobedience"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"**There were chapters in its history when Russia might have taken a more democratic path.** It had strong traditions of self-rule in its medieval city republics, in the peasant commune and the Cossack hetmanates and not least in the zemstvos, which might have laid the basis for a more inclusive form of national government. There were moments when its rulers edged towards a constitutional reform, only for their liberal initiatives to be overturned by the current of events pushing Russia closer to the tragedy of 1917. **And in the chaos of the revolution there were moments when the people were able to reshape the state in line with their old utopian dreams of social justice and freedom**."*
