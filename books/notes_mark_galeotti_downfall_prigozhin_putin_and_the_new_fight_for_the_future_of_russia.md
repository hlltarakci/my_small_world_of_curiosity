- [Евгений Пригожин](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Prigozhin)
- *"...our feeling was that he represented an archetype of the Putin regime, whom we could use to explore some of our respective interests."*
- *"...The Soviet police, the militsia, were not always the most efficient, but they were methodical."*
- *"...Still, in the 1960s, it was perfectly possible to feed a family of three on one and a half rubles a day. Staples including bread, grain, cheese and milk were cheap, while poultry and beef, and even vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers, were readily available. Subsidised housing, however cramped, meant that you had a guaranteed roof over your head, and it was exceedingly difficult to get fired from your job....This was blat, the economy of favours, and integral to Soviet life as the centrally planned economy continued to fail to deliver the plenty that successive Communist Party leaders had promised."*
- *"...The problem was that he was surrounded by criminals who enjoyed a standard of living he felt he never could achieve just by playing the game. ‘There was a highly visible class of the elite, which consisted of children of high-ranking Party bosses, diplomats, department store directors, or any significant post in the food supply chain,’ a Russian entrepreneur of Prigozhin’s generation would recall. ‘That elite class had everything, and doctor families did not. Those people flaunted their wealth. They dressed better. They had cars, clothes. But corruption was widespread, and you couldn’t get a cushy job like that without first embezzling and then bribing your way to the top.’"*
- *"...Yet even if you were willing, you still had to know the right people. Soviet society was not only riven by economic inequalities, there were also divisions of class and caste that, perversely, worked against the intelligentsia. Members of the Soviet intelligentsia imposed a certain moral and intellectual code on themselves and especially on their children. This was the irony of Soviet socialism: it created new class divisions and snobberies at least as rigid and oppressive as the bourgeois societies it affected to despise.....especially at a time when there were quotas limiting how many students of Jewish heritage (his father came from a Jewish family) would be accepted....Nonetheless, Soviet authorities had a great deal of say where people got to live and work, and this was especially true of a convicted felon.
- *"...The teenager had an impulsivity and what one of his gangmates would call an ‘inner cruelty’ that supercharged his ambition. He fled back to Leningrad where, if he had already been labelled a thief, he was determined to be a good one. On 6 October 1981, he was sentenced to 13 years in a high-security correctional labour colony."*
- *"...One didn’t listen to the ponderous speeches of the Communist Party’s general secretaries if one could avoid it. With their repetitive, obsessive citations of Leninist doctrine, their obligatory quotations from past Party congresses, and their dogmatic proclamations of the obvious filled with meaningless factoids, they were not just tedious, they seemed to have little connection with the realities of Soviet life."*
- [перестройка](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika) - [гласность](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost) - [Михаил Горбачёв](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev)
- *"..**It was unheard of – you couldn’t simply complain about standards of living like that.....‘For the first time, the Soviet leader talked like a simple normal person.’ The very word that Mikhail Gorbachev used in passing, perestroika, literally rebuilding, might be a staple of any normal, elected Western politician promising structural change, but in the Soviet context, where difficult things were just not said openly, and where challenging dogma was so existentially dangerous, it was revolutionary. Gorbachev was just beginning his own journey, which would start with his believing that the system was fundamentally redeemable, just needing some housekeeping and modernisation, and end with him all but turning against the Party and ultimately signing the Soviet Union out of existence. In the process, the economy would effectively collapse and the ‘fraternal bonds’ holding this multi-ethnic empire together fray and break. At first, though, this was a time of excitement and growing optimism.**."*
- *"..**Gorbachev would preach glasnost, loosely translated as ‘speaking up’: a more honest reappraisal of the country’s blood-soaked past and its dysfunctional present. In time, this would spin out of control as there were just too many skeletons in the Party’s closet for this to be manageable. In the early days, though, it promised a new era, one in which people were citizens and not subjects. Previously banned books appeared on the shelves, and people who had once derided Soviet newspapers as little more than badly printed toilet paper lined up to read them in their thousands, such that copies had to be displayed on stands in the streets since they sold out so quickly. Gorbachev also hoped to tap public enthusiasm to reform the moribund economy. Just as glasnost encouraged civic agency, perestroika would see efforts to harness entrepreneurialism. Through small businesses called kooperativy, cooperatives, the idea was that people would find that hard work and enterprise would be rewarded – legally. For many, it was, but reform would increasingly expose fundamental contradictions in the system. How could private business and the planned economy truly coexist? How could a Party that had presided over industrial-scale murder and repression claim legitimacy? How could a reform programme promising to work within Soviet rule of law cope when the logic of those reforms undermined or dismantled that very system of legality? Gorbachev came to power hoping to preserve the system through reform; instead, he destroyed it. The optimism of the early years would give way to anger and misery. The cooperative movement was largely strangled by bureaucratic obstructionism and predatory officials. Party conservatives increasingly openly conspired against Gorbachev, and would eventually even launch an abortive coup against him in August 1991. The economy lurched into crisis: by the later 1980s, sausages, grain and butter were being rationed in most of the country......Nonetheless, the public energy and enthusiasm Gorbachev had unleashed would not disappear. Instead, people turned to new causes, from anti-Soviet nationalism to religion, from get-rich-quick schemes to an emerging ecological movement.**."*
- *"...the Zone, the Soviet penal camp system. Old hands in the criminal subculture of the vorovskoi mir, the ‘thieves’ world’, would claim that their real life was that lived inside the Zone. Rather than the prisons of the West, the Soviets – and the Russians after them – largely sent their criminals to penal colonies. There, living in crowded barracks blocks, the inmates largely kept their own code exalting thuggish machismo and made their own rules, exploiting and abusing those who broke them out of ignorance or defiance."*
- *"...He had not been a hard childhood, at least not by Soviet standards, and it certainly was not the case that he had lacked the chance for a normal, decent life. Yet there always seems to have been a tension between his ambitions and his opportunities – until he found himself in the Zone."*
- *"...**The 1980s had transformed the Soviet Union, empowered a new generation and brought free enterprise out of the black market and into the open. The old unspoken rules of Soviet society – Не верь, не бойся, не проси (do not trust, do not fear, do not ask) – were seemingly banished.**."*
- *"...Prigozhin was a man already prepared for the coming decade. The end of the Soviet Union ushered in a time of troubles, in which a handful would become vastly rich while most went hungry, in which organised and disorganised crime alike would prey on the emerging capitalist market, and in which the old rules no longer applied while the new ones were yet to be made. Mercedes-Benz would sell more bulletproof limousines in 1990s Russia than in the rest of the world put together and if in Soviet times everyone had spare rubles because there was nothing in the shops to buy, now everything was available, but no one had any money. Ambition, enterprise, cunning and a willingness to use violence and threats would be essential to prospering in this brave new world, and Zhenya had them all."*
- *"...**In 1990, as the Soviet Union was opening up, many of the creature comforts that Westerners took for granted were coveted as exotic luxuries by people accustomed to deficits, and who saw them more on screen than in real life. Hamburgers, denim jeans, bananas – these simple things were in such high demand that people queued up for miles for McDonald’s, and street-corner rubbish bins were buried deep in banana peels. All this pent-up, unmet demand offered enormous business opportunities for anyone with the hustle and entrepreneurship to make and move product......The ruble, which the state had for so long artificially pegged at parity to the dollar, was beginning its long, painful slide towards its real market value.....This may have sounded like easy money, and for the Western free-market economists watching from afar and the young, liberal intellectuals advising Gorbachev, all this emerging capitalism was indeed beautiful to behold. But that was as long as you were far enough away from Aprashka not to hear the gunshots. Like most retail hubs in Soviet cities, and Moscow and Leningrad in particular, these open markets were fast becoming centres of criminality. While making money may have been easy, keeping it (and your life) was anything but.**."*
- [блат](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blat_(favors))
- *"....**There was officially no capitalism in the Soviet Union then, but in practice everyone also played the black market: you had to, to survive. There certainly was an economy, trading something you have for something that you want, from goods to favours....liberal, pro-Western intellectuals who were aware that the Soviet economy simply wasn’t working because there were fundamental contradictions between the rigid ideology that the government sought to enforce through its laws and the way commerce actually worked on the ground. This was, after all, a time when блат – meaning pull, or favours – was as much a currency as those overvalued rubles.**."*
- *"....**However, the moment when it became possible to talk openly about all these things outside of one’s kitchen, when a new Party leadership under Mikhail Gorbachev was sparking hope of reform, of actually building something in which it was worth believing, that was when the young man (Putin) was sent off to serve in Dresden, East Germany, one of the backwaters of the Warsaw Pact. While it had better beer than back home, he missed out entirely on the optimism, change and hope that his country experienced in those brief five years....After returning from Dresden in 1990, watching an empire he had sworn to protect crumble, 38-year-old Vladimir Putin left the KGB.**."*
- *"...**But virtually overnight, the elite he had joined had been stripped of any status, any meaning. No wonder corruption became ubiquitous: in the absence of values, what other motivation was there but money?....order. But now there is no central idea in Russia. However bad the idea that Russia used to have, it was still there. Now, there is nothing. What is it that we are trying to attain? Personal profit? But then where are the boundaries?’**."*
- *"....One had or could make the money; the other could offer access and security. Both ended up empowering each other, but at the cost of enabling and perpetuating the lawlessness that had pushed them into each other’s arms in the first place."*
- *"....Russian folklore is filled with such tales of a lowly serf rising to serve the tsar. While these fairy tales usually have happy endings, as Herzen’s account suggests, the real ones were fraught with tragedy and danger: it is rare that social climbers ever feel at home among the elites, who will eternally regard them as suspect outsiders, even as they take advantage of them.......‘Vladimir Putin saw how I turned a kiosk into a business,’ he would boast years later, long before the resentment started to set in that would overflow and lead to his downfall. ‘He saw how I do not hesitate personally to bring a plate to crowned heads, because they came to visit me. And I tried my best.’"*
- *"....Старая таможня in particular were vulnerable not just to racketeers demanding protection money, but to this far more mundane, and far more ubiquitous, semi-legal racket. It took a particular skill to distinguish those whom one could afford to brush off from those who needed to be paid off, lest they cause real damage. The best response to such predators was to have a strong, high krysha, or ‘roof’ – in other words, protection. And the best krysha in 1990s St Petersburg was City Hall."*
- *"....[Семь-сорок (7:40)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105351/) (7/40, also the name of a popular 1992 comedy film about Soviet immigrants heading to the United States)..."*
- *"....**making something more expensive than it needed to be was part of a widespread and depressingly effective business strategy. As one joke went, a New Russian shows off his new watch to a friend. ‘How much did you pay for it?’ the friend asks. ‘Two hundred bucks, why?’ ‘You fool – they’re selling them for $500 just around the corner.’**"*
- *"....**There has been much confusion about the nature of Russian political corruption, confounding foreign policymakers and businessmen, who often assume it works just like corruption in Western democracies. In the environment that was quickly taking hold after the collapse of the Soviet Union – where Soviet rule of law had been obliterated and a new system had not yet been built – it was not that money could buy you power so much as that power got you money. Even the oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man who nonetheless went to jail for trying to challenge the system, knew that you accrued and held your wealth at the pleasure of the tsar because, ultimately, he was the one who held the final monopoly on the use of force.**."*
- *"....**the unspoken rules of the game, the [понятия](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_in_law)**..."*
- *"....**formed a [тусовка](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0#Russian) – the slang of the day for a tight clique of like-minded people – of politicians, security officials and simply friends who would go on to make up the core of Vladimir Putin’s government**."*
- *"....**It is impossible to overstate the degree to which power became personalised under Putin. When he became president at the end of 1999, he began to appoint his friends and former colleagues to key positions throughout the system, putting a premium on loyalty above competence......There was the future stand-in president, Dmitry Medvedev, back then a liberal, who was another of Sobchak’s former students.**."*
