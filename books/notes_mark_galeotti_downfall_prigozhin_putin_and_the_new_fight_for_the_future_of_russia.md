- *"...our feeling was that he represented an archetype of the Putin regime, whom we could use to explore some of our respective interests."*
- *"...The Soviet police, the militsia, were not always the most efficient, but they were methodical."*
- *"...Still, in the 1960s, it was perfectly possible to feed a family of three on one and a half rubles a day. Staples including bread, grain, cheese and milk were cheap, while poultry and beef, and even vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers, were readily available. Subsidised housing, however cramped, meant that you had a guaranteed roof over your head, and it was exceedingly difficult to get fired from your job....This was blat, the economy of favours, and integral to Soviet life as the centrally planned economy continued to fail to deliver the plenty that successive Communist Party leaders had promised."*
- *"...The problem was that he was surrounded by criminals who enjoyed a standard of living he felt he never could achieve just by playing the game. ‘There was a highly visible class of the elite, which consisted of children of high-ranking Party bosses, diplomats, department store directors, or any significant post in the food supply chain,’ a Russian entrepreneur of Prigozhin’s generation would recall. ‘That elite class had everything, and doctor families did not. Those people flaunted their wealth. They dressed better. They had cars, clothes. But corruption was widespread, and you couldn’t get a cushy job like that without first embezzling and then bribing your way to the top.’"*
- *"...Yet even if you were willing, you still had to know the right people. Soviet society was not only riven by economic inequalities, there were also divisions of class and caste that, perversely, worked against the intelligentsia. Members of the Soviet intelligentsia imposed a certain moral and intellectual code on themselves and especially on their children. This was the irony of Soviet socialism: it created new class divisions and snobberies at least as rigid and oppressive as the bourgeois societies it affected to despise.....especially at a time when there were quotas limiting how many students of Jewish heritage (his father came from a Jewish family) would be accepted....Nonetheless, Soviet authorities had a great deal of say where people got to live and work, and this was especially true of a convicted felon.
- *"...The teenager had an impulsivity and what one of his gangmates would call an ‘inner cruelty’ that supercharged his ambition. He fled back to Leningrad where, if he had already been labelled a thief, he was determined to be a good one. On 6 October 1981, he was sentenced to 13 years in a high-security correctional labour colony."*
- *"...One didn’t listen to the ponderous speeches of the Communist Party’s general secretaries if one could avoid it. With their repetitive, obsessive citations of Leninist doctrine, their obligatory quotations from past Party congresses, and their dogmatic proclamations of the obvious filled with meaningless factoids, they were not just tedious, they seemed to have little connection with the realities of Soviet life."*
- [перестройка](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika) - [гласность](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost) - [Михаил Горбачёв](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev)
- *"..**It was unheard of – you couldn’t simply complain about standards of living like that.....‘For the first time, the Soviet leader talked like a simple normal person.’ The very word that Mikhail Gorbachev used in passing, perestroika, literally rebuilding, might be a staple of any normal, elected Western politician promising structural change, but in the Soviet context, where difficult things were just not said openly, and where challenging dogma was so existentially dangerous, it was revolutionary. Gorbachev was just beginning his own journey, which would start with his believing that the system was fundamentally redeemable, just needing some housekeeping and modernisation, and end with him all but turning against the Party and ultimately signing the Soviet Union out of existence. In the process, the economy would effectively collapse and the ‘fraternal bonds’ holding this multi-ethnic empire together fray and break. At first, though, this was a time of excitement and growing optimism.**."*
- *"..**Gorbachev would preach glasnost, loosely translated as ‘speaking up’: a more honest reappraisal of the country’s blood-soaked past and its dysfunctional present. In time, this would spin out of control as there were just too many skeletons in the Party’s closet for this to be manageable. In the early days, though, it promised a new era, one in which people were citizens and not subjects. Previously banned books appeared on the shelves, and people who had once derided Soviet newspapers as little more than badly printed toilet paper lined up to read them in their thousands, such that copies had to be displayed on stands in the streets since they sold out so quickly. Gorbachev also hoped to tap public enthusiasm to reform the moribund economy. Just as glasnost encouraged civic agency, perestroika would see efforts to harness entrepreneurialism. Through small businesses called kooperativy, cooperatives, the idea was that people would find that hard work and enterprise would be rewarded – legally. For many, it was, but reform would increasingly expose fundamental contradictions in the system. How could private business and the planned economy truly coexist? How could a Party that had presided over industrial-scale murder and repression claim legitimacy? How could a reform programme promising to work within Soviet rule of law cope when the logic of those reforms undermined or dismantled that very system of legality? Gorbachev came to power hoping to preserve the system through reform; instead, he destroyed it. The optimism of the early years would give way to anger and misery. The cooperative movement was largely strangled by bureaucratic obstructionism and predatory officials. Party conservatives increasingly openly conspired against Gorbachev, and would eventually even launch an abortive coup against him in August 1991. The economy lurched into crisis: by the later 1980s, sausages, grain and butter were being rationed in most of the country......Nonetheless, the public energy and enthusiasm Gorbachev had unleashed would not disappear. Instead, people turned to new causes, from anti-Soviet nationalism to religion, from get-rich-quick schemes to an emerging ecological movement.**."*
- *"...the Zone, the Soviet penal camp system. Old hands in the criminal subculture of the vorovskoi mir, the ‘thieves’ world’, would claim that their real life was that lived inside the Zone. Rather than the prisons of the West, the Soviets – and the Russians after them – largely sent their criminals to penal colonies. There, living in crowded barracks blocks, the inmates largely kept their own code exalting thuggish machismo and made their own rules, exploiting and abusing those who broke them out of ignorance or defiance."*
- *"...He had not been a hard childhood, at least not by Soviet standards, and it certainly was not the case that he had lacked the chance for a normal, decent life. Yet there always seems to have been a tension between his ambitions and his opportunities – until he found himself in the Zone."*
- *"...**The 1980s had transformed the Soviet Union, empowered a new generation and brought free enterprise out of the black market and into the open. The old unspoken rules of Soviet society – Не верь, не бойся, не проси (do not trust, do not fear, do not ask) – were seemingly banished.**."*
- *"...Prigozhin was a man already prepared for the coming decade. The end of the Soviet Union ushered in a time of troubles, in which a handful would become vastly rich while most went hungry, in which organised and disorganised crime alike would prey on the emerging capitalist market, and in which the old rules no longer applied while the new ones were yet to be made. Mercedes-Benz would sell more bulletproof limousines in 1990s Russia than in the rest of the world put together and if in Soviet times everyone had spare rubles because there was nothing in the shops to buy, now everything was available, but no one had any money. Ambition, enterprise, cunning and a willingness to use violence and threats would be essential to prospering in this brave new world, and Zhenya had them all."*
