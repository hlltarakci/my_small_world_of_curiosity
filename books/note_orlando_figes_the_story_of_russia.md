Peter added term of Rossia which replace Rus as the name of Russian state. Rossia signified imperial identity regardless of ethnicity. If Moscow was ancient capital of Rus, Petersburg was capital of Rossia...The Law Code had marked a shift towards a law-governed realm.

No compulsory disarmament had ever been imposed on a defeated great power. Not even France had been disarmed after the Napoleonic Wars. The way Russia was treated was unprecedented for Europe, which was supposed to be guided by the principal that no great power should be humbled by others.

It hit them hardest in a band of provinces..areas where the peasants suffered from both shortages of land and loss of jobs to the machines. These were the regions where the peasant revolution was most violant in 1905 and 1917. The emancipation was the first in a series of reforms in the 1860s, the so-called Great Reforms...One of the problems of the tsarist system was absence of provincial institutions in could entrust to extend its influence and run local government...The judicial reforms set up an independent legal system with public jury trials. There were new laws granting autonomy to universities, expanding primary schooling, relaxing cencorship. Aim was to put society on its feet and let it flex its muscles. Had the spirit of 1860s continued, Russia might have become a more liberal society."*
- Chapter 7 - *"Civil society began to organise and represent itself through institutions of its own making...Russia, was at last, developing the civic institutions that any country needs to build a political democracy. The zemstvos had the most potential in this liberal development. Run by well meaning men who dreamed of bringing civilisation to the countryside (like fro Tolstoy or Checkhov books), they founded schools and hospitals,..with the mission to improve the welfare of the peasantry. The "small deeds liberalism" of the provincial zemstvos was not a challenge to central state. Indeed, in fo far as the crucial weakness of tsarist system was the under-government of localities, they were a vital supplement to it"*

He did not see the need to adapt his rule to the demands of the new world...On Sunday, 9 Jan 1905, a large crowd of workers marched towards the Winter Palace to hand in a petition to the tsar. On his orders, soldiers fired at the crowd. In that moment, the folk myth of tsar-batiushka, an idea that had underpinned the monarchy for centuries, was finally destroyed...On 17 October, he reluctantly agreed to sign a Manifesto, granting freedoms of speech, assembly and religion, establishing a legislative parliament, Duma...Nicholas was increasingly removed from political reality. He was retreating into a fantasy of popular autocracy, such as he imagined had existed in medieval Muscovy. That was why he tolerated Rasputin...Nicholas had become a victim of his regimes's propaganda about people's devotion to him. But that myth had been destroyed on Bloody Sunday."*

- Chapter 8 "Revolutionary Russia" - *"..It was hard to tell how much of this anger was patriotically motivated and how much based on hatred of the wealthy urban class. The revolutionary mode was nationalist in character...In September 1915, in a desparate attempt to restore morale, Nicholas took over supreme command. He thought that his presence at the front would inspire the soldiers, that if they would not fight for Russia they would surely to do so for their holy tsar. It was a terrible mistake. From this point, Nicholas took the blame for every defeat. To explain the unending sequence of defeats, it was said that he was informing the Kaiser about the movement of his troops. There was no truth in this rumours. But that was not the point. The fact that people were prepared to believe them made them politically dangerous. In a revolutionary crisis it is perceptions and beliefs, not realities, that count. Through their ability to mobilise an opposition and give its protests meaning as a patriotic act, they contributed to the revolutionary mood."*
- Chapter 8 - *"The end of the monarchy was marked by scenes of rejoicing through the empire. The monarchy was dead. All its institutions of support had collapsed virtually overnight. Leon Trotsky: 'The country had so radically vomited up monarchy that it could never ever crawl down the people's throat again'...But if politically monarchy was dead, it was still alive in a broader sense, in the psychology that made the people so receptive to later Soviet cults of the leader. Misconception: 'We want a democratic republic and a tsar batiushka for three years'."*

He suggested that each town should develop its own means of cleansing the Russian land...collective responsibility, applied now to a whole social class...The soldiers took the decree as a license to demobilise, to carry out the revolution in their towns. Without the army, Bolsheviks are open for peace talks with Germans. They were divided over strategy: Left wing against, it would end all hopes to spread revolution to West.

Slogan: 'Soviet without Communists'. Bolshevik power ceased to exist in much f the countryside. It was not just the shortages that angered them. They were protesting against the loss of rights hard won in 1917."*
- Chapter 8 - *"It meant abandoning the War Communism and laying the foundations of a New Economic Policy (NEP) in which private trade and small scale manufacturing would be allowed within the socialist system. There were many Bolsheviks who feared that this would lead to the return to the capitalist system. But Lenin insisted that as long as state controls the heavy industry and national resources, there was no danger in allowing private farming. To enforce party unity, Lenin also introduced a ban on factions inside the party. Questioning the decisions could mean expulsion from the party...NEP was to be a tenporary retreat from the utopian dream of building socialism. Lenin told: 'Only in countries with developed capitalism was it possible to make an immediate transition to socialism.' This was what the Mensheviks had said in 1917...Bolsheviks would have to change their ways, if Lenin's vision was to be achieved. They could no longer rule by threating people with rifles. Now, lenin warned, they had to proceed more slowly. They needed Western eduation and culture, to learn how to govern properly."*

They dreamed of revolution spreading through world as a liberating force. That was why they set up the Comintern, the Communist International, to organise Communists of other countries under Moscow's leadership. Through the Comintern, Russia gained a new position on the international stage. Communisn gave it a new messianic role...By 1924 it had become apparent, however, that a revolution in the West was unlikely. The immediate post-war instability had passed. Now Soviet Union, formed by the Russian, Transcaucasion, Ukrainian and Belarusian, had to become self-sufficient and build industries with capital from its own economy.

It was connected to the obligations of krugovaya poruka, medieval principal of collective responsibility. During the Great Terror, this tradition was reflected."*
- Chapter 9 - *"If there was a rationale for this Great Purge it was Stalin's fear of a fifth column in the coming war, which he thought was unavoidable.

Russia had existed as an empire for so long that it could not simply reinvent itself as a nation after 1991...New national holidays were established. Those of the Russian church were all restored. Soviet holidays were still observed. The vacuum created by the Soviet collapse was being filled with everybperiod of Russian history."*
- Chapter 11 - *"Putin's view of the country's history is statist and conservative. His reading of it tells him that Russia had been strong when its people are united behind a strong state; weak when the people were divided and lost sigh of Russian principals that united and distinguished them."*
- Chapter 11 - *"The meaning of sovereign democracy, as Surkov defined it, was that Russia should be free to choose its own political system and call it a democracy. The sovereignty depended on their own belief that the system they now had was the outcome of their history, of every stage of it, and that it was of their own making."*

- Chapter 11 - *"Putin: As to some problematic pages in our history - yes we've had them. But what state hasn't? And we've had fewer of such pages than some other states. And ours were not as horrible as those of some others. Yes, we have had some terrible pages: let us remember the events beginning in 1937, let us not forget about them. But other countries have had no less, and even more. In any case we did not pour chemicals over thousands of kilometers or drop on a small country seven times more bombs than during the entire WW2, as the US did in Vietnam., for instance. Nor did we have other black pages, such as Nasizm. All sorts of things happen in the history of every state. And we cannot allow ourselves to be saddled with guilt."*

- Chapter 11 - ***"During his first term in office, Putin looked to further Russia’s integration with the West. In interviews he spelled out his vision of the country as ‘part of western European culture’, and said that he was open to the possibility of Russia joining NATO and the European Union...'We will strive to remain where geography and our spirit have placed us, but if we are pushed out,' Putin warned, 'we will be forced to seek other ties to strengthen ourselves.' It was a recurring pattern running right through Russian history since at least the eighteenth century. Russia wanted to be part of Europe, to be treated with respect. But if it was rejected by the West’s leaders, or if they humiliated it, Russia would rebuild itself and arm itself against the West...NATO and the EU missed an opportunity to end this historical cycle. Instead of trying to bring Russia into new security arrangements for Europe, NATO kept it isolated. The US and its North Atlantic allies acted as if the Cold War had been ‘won’ by them, and that Russia, the ‘defeated’ power, need not be consulted on the consequences of the Soviet collapse in regions where the Russians had historic interests. The effect of Western actions was to reinforce the Russians’ own resentments of the West. On the back of years of anti-Western propaganda during the Cold War it did not take a lot to persuade them that a hostile West refused to recognise their country as an equal and took advantage of its current weakness to diminish it. This was the basis on which Putin built his anti-Western ideology.”***
- Chapter 11 - *"The real rupture with the West came with NATO’s eastward expansion. In the Kremlin’s thinking it was linked to the spread of US-sponsored democratic movements in its sphere of influence that posed a threat to Russia’s ‘sovereign democracy’. In 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were granted NATO membership. Five years later, Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also joined the alliance. **Moscow saw this as a betrayal of a verbal promise made by the Americans on the collapse of the Berlin Wall that NATO would not advance ‘even one inch to the east’. Many on the US side denied giving such a guarantee, or argued that it had been meant for eastern Germany, not for all the Warsaw Pact countries**."*
- Chapter 11 - *"Whatever the reality, **NATO’s eastward expansion poisoned its relations with Russia**. George Kennan, who had shaped the Cold War policy of Soviet containment in 1946, warned that it would be a ‘tragic mistake’ to encroach on the territories “be a ‘tragic mistake’ to encroach on the territories of the former Warsaw Pact. **‘It shows so little understanding of Russian history,’ he told the New York Times in 1998. ‘Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then NATO will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are – but this is just wrong.’ That indeed is how events turned out..By provoking Russian aggression, NATO had created the very problem it was meant to counteract. It was as if it needed an aggressive Russia to justify its existence**"*
- Chapter 11 - *"Putin spoke of the need for Russia to restore its influence in what he called the ‘Russian world’ (Russkii mir), a concept he attached to the defence of ‘traditional Russian values’ within the borders of the former Soviet Union. The ‘Russian world’ idea had been advanced by the patriarch of the Orthodox Church to promote its spiritual inheritance from Kievan Rus, a link broken by the break-up of the Soviet Union. It was seized on by Putin, who used it as an arm of his foreign policy from 2012. The ‘Russian world’, he said, was a ‘family’ of Slavs, the Russians, the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, who shared a common history, religion and cultural inheritance from Kievan Rus. This world had been torn apart by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ‘greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century’, as he had described it in a 2005 address. ‘As for the Russian nation,’ he went on, ‘it became a real drama. Tens of millions of our citizens and compatriots found themselves outside the territory of Russia."*

- Chapter 11 - *"The Slavophiles had argued that Russia should be seen as a ‘spiritual civilisation’ broader than its territorial boundaries. Putin argued that it was the mission of the Russian state to defend the ‘tens of millions of our citizens’ who had been stranded outside Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. ..language served as the president’s excuse to intervene in former Soviet countries where Russian-speakers formed a large minority. The fact that they were citizens of foreign sovereign states, and identified themselves as such, did not count in Putin’s view...His thinking here was possibly derived from Danilevsky’s Russia and Europe, in which the Pan-Slav thinker had maintained that Russia was a distinctive multi-cultural civilisation, neither understood nor recognised by Europe, which saw it only as an aggressor state and wanted to diminish it. Russia was not part of Europe, Danilevsky argued, and should not seek its approval or measure its own progress by its ‘universal’ principles, which were in fact self-serving, a means for Europe to impose its values on other civilisations. Following the West could only weaken Russia, which should stand against it if it wanted to defend its own conservative and religious traditions...More than any other country in the world, Ivan Ilyin argued, Russia had a ‘heavy cross to bear’ on account of its harsh climate, its vast land mass to defend and its history of suffering; but it had emerged from these ordeals with a special spiritual strength, a capacity for love and selfless sacrifice, which, if mastered by a ‘national dictator’, would liberate it from the Bolsheviks and lead to its national renewal as a holy empire in Eurasia."*

- Chapter 11 - *"**Ukraine soon became the battlefield for this ‘clash of civilisations’ between Russia and the West.** Although the Putin government had many times declared its recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty, it never really came round to accepting it. **In Putin’s view Ukraine had occupied the borderlands of ‘historical’ or ‘greater’ Russia since the times of Kievan Rus. It was an inseparable part of the ‘Russian world’.** Too many families, communities, were made up of both Russians and Ukrainians; the economies of the two countries were too integrated to be pulled apart. Russia’s gas was piped to Europe through Ukraine. Its most important naval base was at Sevastopol in the **Crimea, a mainly Russian territory assigned to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic by Khrushchev in 1954** to mark the tercentenary of Russia’s union with the Cossack hetmanate. Little significance had been attached to Khrushchev’s gift. There were no national boundaries in the Soviet Union. **But after 1991 the loss of the Crimea was sorely felt by the Russians**, who had spent their holidays at its resorts and learned at school that it was ‘theirs’... **Crimea was the birthplace of Russia’s Christianity, where Prince Vladimir had been baptised, the symbolic home of the ‘Russian soul’** – that, at least, was how it was presented by the propagandists of the ‘Russian world’."*
- Chapter 11 - *"Putin pursued a policy of keeping Ukraine weak, divided and dependent on Russia. He regarded Russia’s domination of Ukraine as a necessary measure to prevent its falling under Western influence. He feared Ukraine as a burgeoning democracy whose freedoms were a threat to his own authoritarian regime (the ‘Orange Revolution’ of 2004–5, **in which mass protests had reversed the rigged election of the pro-Russian presidential candidate Yanukovich to secure the victory of Viktor Yushchenko, alarmed the Kremlin in particular**). His strategy was reminiscent of tsarist policies towards Russia’s neighbouring states, especially the Ottoman Empire. The tsars had used their military might as a means of armed diplomacy. By threatening the sultan’s Balkan territories, and, if necessary, occupying them, they had forced him to concede to their demands in the Black Sea and the Holy Lands. Putin adopted the same tactics in Ukraine. **Instead of the defence of the Orthodox abroad, the pretext used by the tsars to interfere in European Turkey, he invoked the defence of ‘the millions’ of former Russian citizens to justify his interference in Ukrainian affairs.**"*
- Chapter 11 - *“The Putin regime backed pro-Russian leaders in Ukraine, and made things hard for those who favoured closer integration with Europe. Divisions in Ukraine played into the Kremlin’s hands. **There was a historical divide between the western regions, which had been part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and then the Austrian–Hungarian Empire, where Ukrainian was widely spoken, and the eastern regions of Ukraine, where Russian was the dominant language. Because of the Russian presence in the east, no government could take Ukraine too close to Europe without risking civil war; but the European outlook of the western provinces meant that realigning the country with Russia would be just as dangerous.**"*
- Chapter 11 - *"The delicate balance was upset by two developments. The first was **Putin’s long-term plan to include Ukraine in a Eurasian Economic Union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, among other countries of the former Soviet Union. Putin envisaged the Eurasian Union one day growing into something like the European Union under Russia’s leadership – a Eurasian bloc to counteract the West.** The second was the outbreak of mass protests in Kiev and other west Ukrainian cities from the autumn of 2013. Occupying Maidan Square in Kiev, the demonstrators called on the Yanukovich government (elected fair and square in the 2010 elections) to sign an Association Agreement with the EU. Yanukovich had negotiated the agreement, only to suspend preparations for it under pressure from Moscow. Shooting at the crowds by unidentified snipers (probably special forces of the Yanukovich government) turned the protests into a revolution, the Maidan Revolution, watched by TV audiences around the world. By 22 February 2014, the protesters had gained control of Kiev. Yanukovich fled to east Ukraine, and later to Russia, while a caretaker government was formed in the Ukrainian parliament."*
- Chapter 11 - *"Seizing on the questionable parallel with Kosovo, where NATO’s intervention had secured the Albanians’ right to self-determination, the Kremlin launched a new Crimean War to defend what it claimed were the same rights for the Russians of the Crimea...**in which 97 per cent of the people voted for reunion with Russia. Even with a properly conducted plebiscite the same decision would have been reached by a large majority.** But Putin did not need to play by international rules. He knew that NATO would not act to defend Ukrainian territory. Russian might had called its bluff. **The annexation of Crimea was broadly welcomed by the population in Russia. There was a sense that an unjust loss of Russian territory – a symbol of the loss of Russia’s empire and great-power status in the world – had been reversed. National pride had been restored.**"*
- Chapter 11 - *"Soon after the Crimean invasion Putin sent in military aid to the separatist fighters in the east, later reinforcing them with unbadged Russian troops in a war that rumbled on for the next eight years, claiming 20,000 Russian and Ukrainian lives. The warring parties failed to reach agreement on the Minsk II Accords, a peace plan brokered by the Germans and the French under which Ukraine would regain its sovereignty in the disputed eastern areas, including its control of the border with Russia, while the Donbass would be given full autonomy in a more decentralised Ukraine. All this time the West continued buying Russian fossil fuels. In ‘Londongrad’, a safe British haven for the oligarchs, law firms, bankers, tax consultants, art dealers and real estate agents carried on as usual as their money launderers."*
- Chapter 11 - *"**The Russian economy had adapted to the sanctions and had largely recovered.** Thanks to sales of oil and gas, the country’s foreign currency reserves had grown to $500 billion, the fourth largest in the world. It gave Putin the war chest he would need to go on fighting in Ukraine while maintaining living standards in Russia. He was not afraid of more sanctions."*
- Chapter 11 - *"**Putin saw the role of NATO in Ukraine as a direct military threat.** In an hour-long address to the Russian people on 21 February 2022, he claimed that Ukraine would ‘serve as an advanced bridgehead’ for NATO’s forces to attack Russia unless Moscow intervened. Under the guise of its training missions, NATO, he declared, was building bases in Ukrainian cities like Kharkiv, near the Russian border, from which its nuclear missiles could reach Moscow in a few minutes. **‘It is like a knife to our throat,’ he said.** From a Western point of view this seemed mad and paranoid. **NATO, after all, was a defensive alliance and had no reason to attack Russia. But as Putin saw it, it was the conclusion to be drawn from his reading of the history of Russia and Ukraine.**...**He demanded a written guarantee that Ukraine would never become part of NATO.**"*
- Chapter 11 - *"Few people thought that he would launch a full-scale invasion...His decision surprised even senior Kremlin officials. **It must be explained by Putin’s isolation from reality. Terrified of Covid, he had spent the past two years in lockdown on his own in the Kremlin**. After twenty-two years in power, Putin had become an autocrat. No one dared to question him...His spies in Kiev had told him that Zelensky’s government would soon collapse: it had ruined the economy and lost the support of the Ukrainians, who would welcome Russia’s troops with open arms. They were too afraid to disillusion him by telling him the truth."*
- Chapter 11 - *"How will this war end, and what sort of Russia will emerge from it? None of the possible scenarios bodes well for Russia or Ukraine...A military defeat for Russia is the first and least likely possibility...The second possible scenario is a stalemate, a permanently frozen conflict in Ukraine, with Russian troops in the Donbass and the east but neither side prepared to stop the fighting...A Russian victory of some kind is the most likely outcome of this war, given the resources at the Kremlin’s disposal. But what sort of victory can be achieved? Even if the Russians settle for the whole of the Donbass as their ‘victory’, they will still be left with the problem of Ukrainian insurgency and civil disobedience"*
- Chapter 11 - *"**There were chapters in its history when Russia might have taken a more democratic path.** It had strong traditions of self-rule in its medieval city republics, in the peasant commune and the Cossack hetmanates and not least in the zemstvos, which might have laid the basis for a more inclusive form of national government. There were moments when its rulers edged towards a constitutional reform, only for their liberal initiatives to be overturned by the current of events pushing Russia closer to the tragedy of 1917. **And in the chaos of the revolution there were moments when the people were able to reshape the state in line with their old utopian dreams of social justice and freedom**."*
