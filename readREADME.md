It hit them hardest in a band of provinces..areas where the peasants suffered from both shortages of land and loss of jobs to the machines. These were the regions where the peasant revolution was most violant in 1905 and 1917. The emancipation was the first in a series of reforms in the 1860s, the so-called Great Reforms...One of the problems of the tsarist system was absence of provincial institutions in could entrust to extend its influence and run local government...The judicial reforms set up an independent legal system with public jury trials. There were new laws granting autonomy to universities, expanding primary schooling, relaxing cencorship. Aim was to put society on its feet and let it flex its muscles. Had the spirit of 1860s continued, Russia might have become a more liberal society."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"Civil society began to organise and represent itself through institutions of its own making...Russia, was at last, developing the civic institutions that any country needs to build a political democracy. The zemstvos had the most potential in this liberal development. Run by well meaning men who dreamed of bringing civilisation to the countryside (like fro Tolstoy or Checkhov books), they founded schools and hospitals,..with the mission to improve the welfare of the peasantry. The "small deeds liberalism" of the provincial zemstvos was not a challenge to central state. Indeed, in fo far as the crucial weakness of tsarist system was the under-government of localities, they were a vital supplement to it"*

    - Chapter 8 "Revolutionary Russia" - *"..It was hard to tell how much of this anger was patriotically motivated and how much based on hatred of the wealthy urban class. The revolutionary mode was nationalist in character...In September 1915, in a desparate attempt to restore morale, Nicholas took over supreme command. He thought that his presence at the front would inspire the soldiers, that if they would not fight for Russia they would surely to do so for their holy tsar. It was a terrible mistake. From this point, Nicholas took the blame for every defeat. To explain the unending sequence of defeats, it was said that he was informing the Kaiser about the movement of his troops. There was no truth in this rumours. But that was not the point. The fact that people were prepared to believe them made them politically dangerous. In a revolutionary crisis it is perceptions and beliefs, not realities, that count. Through their ability to mobilise an opposition and give its protests meaning as a patriotic act, they contributed to the revolutionary mood."*

Leon Trotsky: 'The country had so radically vomited up monarchy that it could never ever crawl down the people's throat again'...But if politically monarchy was dead, it was still alive in a broader sense, in the psychology that made the people so receptive to later Soviet cults of the leader.

But Lenin insisted that as long as state controls the heavy industry and national resources, there was no danger in allowing private farming. To enforce party unity, Lenin also introduced a ban on factions inside the party. Questioning the decisions could mean expulsion from the party...NEP was to be a tenporary retreat from the utopian dream of building socialism. Lenin told: 'Only in countries with developed capitalism was it possible to make an immediate transition to socialism.' This was what the Mensheviks had said in 1917...Bolsheviks would have to change their ways, if Lenin's vision was to be achieved. They could no longer rule by threating people with rifles. Now, lenin warned, they had to proceed more slowly. They needed Western eduation and culture, to learn how to govern properly."*

    - Chapter 9 "The War on Old Russia" - *"...In their view socialism was unsustainable in Russia on its own because it lacked the industries it needed. They dreamed of revolution spreading through world as a liberating force. That was why they set up the Comintern, the Communist International, to organise Communists of other countries under Moscow's leadership. Through the Comintern, Russia gained a new position on the international stage. Communisn gave it a new messianic role...By 1924 it had become apparent, however, that a revolution in the West was unlikely. The immediate post-war instability had passed. Now Soviet Union, formed by the Russian, Transcaucasion, Ukrainian and Belarusian, had to become self-sufficient and build industries with capital from its own economy. That was the fear that fueled Stalin's rise to power with Five-Year plan."*

    - Chapter 11 - ***"During his first term in office, Putin looked to further Russia’s integration with the West. In interviews he spelled out his vision of the country as ‘part of western European culture’, and said that he was open to the possibility of Russia joining NATO and the European Union...'We will strive to remain where geography and our spirit have placed us, but if we are pushed out,' Putin warned, 'we will be forced to seek other ties to strengthen ourselves.' It was a recurring pattern running right through Russian history since at least the eighteenth century. Russia wanted to be part of Europe, to be treated with respect. But if it was rejected by the West’s leaders, or if they humiliated it, Russia would rebuild itself and arm itself against the West...NATO and the EU missed an opportunity to end this historical cycle. Instead of trying to bring Russia into new security arrangements for Europe, NATO kept it isolated. The US and its North Atlantic allies acted as if the Cold War had been ‘won’ by them, and that Russia, the ‘defeated’ power, need not be consulted on the consequences of the Soviet collapse in regions where the Russians had historic interests. The effect of Western actions was to reinforce the Russians’ own resentments of the West. On the back of years of anti-Western propaganda during the Cold War it did not take a lot to persuade them that a hostile West refused to recognise their country as an equal and took advantage of its current weakness to diminish it. This was the basis on which Putin built his anti-Western ideology.”***
    - Chapter 11 - *"The real rupture with the West came with NATO’s eastward expansion. In the Kremlin’s thinking it was linked to the spread of US-sponsored democratic movements in its sphere of influence that posed a threat to Russia’s ‘sovereign democracy’. In 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were granted NATO membership. Five years later, Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also joined the alliance. **Moscow saw this as a betrayal of a verbal promise made by the Americans on the collapse of the Berlin Wall that NATO would not advance ‘even one inch to the east’. Many on the US side denied giving such a guarantee, or argued that it had been meant for eastern Germany, not for all the Warsaw Pact countries**."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Whatever the reality, **NATO’s eastward expansion poisoned its relations with Russia**. George Kennan, who had shaped the Cold War policy of Soviet containment in 1946, warned that it would be a ‘tragic mistake’ to encroach on the territories “be a ‘tragic mistake’ to encroach on the territories of the former Warsaw Pact. **‘It shows so little understanding of Russian history,’ he told the New York Times in 1998. ‘Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then NATO will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are – but this is just wrong.’ That indeed is how events turned out..By provoking Russian aggression, NATO had created the very problem it was meant to counteract. It was as if it needed an aggressive Russia to justify its existence**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Putin spoke of the need for Russia to restore its influence in what he called the ‘Russian world’ (Russkii mir), a concept he attached to the defence of ‘traditional Russian values’ within the borders of the former Soviet Union. The ‘Russian world’ idea had been advanced by the patriarch of the Orthodox Church to promote its spiritual inheritance from Kievan Rus, a link broken by the break-up of the Soviet Union. It was seized on by Putin, who used it as an arm of his foreign policy from 2012. The ‘Russian world’, he said, was a ‘family’ of Slavs, the Russians, the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, who shared a common history, religion and cultural inheritance from Kievan Rus. This world had been torn apart by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ‘greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century’, as he had described it in a 2005 address. ‘As for the Russian nation,’ he went on, ‘it became a real drama. Tens of millions of our citizens and compatriots found themselves outside the territory of Russia."*

    - Chapter 11 - *"The Slavophiles had argued that Russia should be seen as a ‘spiritual civilisation’ broader than its territorial boundaries. Putin argued that it was the mission of the Russian state to defend the ‘tens of millions of our citizens’ who had been stranded outside Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. ..language served as the president’s excuse to intervene in former Soviet countries where Russian-speakers formed a large minority. The fact that they were citizens of foreign sovereign states, and identified themselves as such, did not count in Putin’s view...His thinking here was possibly derived from Danilevsky’s Russia and Europe, in which the Pan-Slav thinker had maintained that Russia was a distinctive multi-cultural civilisation, neither understood nor recognised by Europe, which saw it only as an aggressor state and wanted to diminish it. Russia was not part of Europe, Danilevsky argued, and should not seek its approval or measure its own progress by its ‘universal’ principles, which were in fact self-serving, a means for Europe to impose its values on other civilisations. Following the West could only weaken Russia, which should stand against it if it wanted to defend its own conservative and religious traditions...More than any other country in the world, Ivan Ilyin argued, Russia had a ‘heavy cross to bear’ on account of its harsh climate, its vast land mass to defend and its history of suffering; but it had emerged from these ordeals with a special spiritual strength, a capacity for love and selfless sacrifice, which, if mastered by a ‘national dictator’, would liberate it from the Bolsheviks and lead to its national renewal as a holy empire in Eurasia."*

    - Chapter 11 - *"**Ukraine soon became the battlefield for this ‘clash of civilisations’ between Russia and the West.** Although the Putin government had many times declared its recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty, it never really came round to accepting it. **In Putin’s view Ukraine had occupied the borderlands of ‘historical’ or ‘greater’ Russia since the times of Kievan Rus. It was an inseparable part of the ‘Russian world’.** Too many families, communities, were made up of both Russians and Ukrainians; the economies of the two countries were too integrated to be pulled apart. Russia’s gas was piped to Europe through Ukraine. Its most important naval base was at Sevastopol in the **Crimea, a mainly Russian territory assigned to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic by Khrushchev in 1954** to mark the tercentenary of Russia’s union with the Cossack hetmanate. Little significance had been attached to Khrushchev’s gift. There were no national boundaries in the Soviet Union. **But after 1991 the loss of the Crimea was sorely felt by the Russians**, who had spent their holidays at its resorts and learned at school that it was ‘theirs’... **Crimea was the birthplace of Russia’s Christianity, where Prince Vladimir had been baptised, the symbolic home of the ‘Russian soul’** – that, at least, was how it was presented by the propagandists of the ‘Russian world’."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Putin pursued a policy of keeping Ukraine weak, divided and dependent on Russia. He regarded Russia’s domination of Ukraine as a necessary measure to prevent its falling under Western influence. He feared Ukraine as a burgeoning democracy whose freedoms were a threat to his own authoritarian regime (the ‘Orange Revolution’ of 2004–5, **in which mass protests had reversed the rigged election of the pro-Russian presidential candidate Yanukovich to secure the victory of Viktor Yushchenko, alarmed the Kremlin in particular**). His strategy was reminiscent of tsarist policies towards Russia’s neighbouring states, especially the Ottoman Empire. The tsars had used their military might as a means of armed diplomacy. By threatening the sultan’s Balkan territories, and, if necessary, occupying them, they had forced him to concede to their demands in the Black Sea and the Holy Lands. Putin adopted the same tactics in Ukraine. **Instead of the defence of the Orthodox abroad, the pretext used by the tsars to interfere in European Turkey, he invoked the defence of ‘the millions’ of former Russian citizens to justify his interference in Ukrainian affairs.**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *“The Putin regime backed pro-Russian leaders in Ukraine, and made things hard for those who favoured closer integration with Europe. Divisions in Ukraine played into the Kremlin’s hands. **There was a historical divide between the western regions, which had been part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and then the Austrian–Hungarian Empire, where Ukrainian was widely spoken, and the eastern regions of Ukraine, where Russian was the dominant language. Because of the Russian presence in the east, no government could take Ukraine too close to Europe without risking civil war; but the European outlook of the western provinces meant that realigning the country with Russia would be just as dangerous.**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"The delicate balance was upset by two developments. The first was **Putin’s long-term plan to include Ukraine in a Eurasian Economic Union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, among other countries of the former Soviet Union. Putin envisaged the Eurasian Union one day growing into something like the European Union under Russia’s leadership – a Eurasian bloc to counteract the West.** The second was the outbreak of mass protests in Kiev and other west Ukrainian cities from the autumn of 2013. Occupying Maidan Square in Kiev, the demonstrators called on the Yanukovich government (elected fair and square in the 2010 elections) to sign an Association Agreement with the EU. Yanukovich had negotiated the agreement, only to suspend preparations for it under pressure from Moscow. Shooting at the crowds by unidentified snipers (probably special forces of the Yanukovich government) turned the protests into a revolution, the Maidan Revolution, watched by TV audiences around the world. By 22 February 2014, the protesters had gained control of Kiev. Yanukovich fled to east Ukraine, and later to Russia, while a caretaker government was formed in the Ukrainian parliament."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Seizing on the questionable parallel with Kosovo, where NATO’s intervention had secured the Albanians’ right to self-determination, the Kremlin launched a new Crimean War to defend what it claimed were the same rights for the Russians of the Crimea...**in which 97 per cent of the people voted for reunion with Russia. Even with a properly conducted plebiscite the same decision would have been reached by a large majority.** But Putin did not need to play by international rules. He knew that NATO would not act to defend Ukrainian territory. Russian might had called its bluff. **The annexation of Crimea was broadly welcomed by the population in Russia. There was a sense that an unjust loss of Russian territory – a symbol of the loss of Russia’s empire and great-power status in the world – had been reversed. National pride had been restored.**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Soon after the Crimean invasion Putin sent in military aid to the separatist fighters in the east, later reinforcing them with unbadged Russian troops in a war that rumbled on for the next eight years, claiming 20,000 Russian and Ukrainian lives. The warring parties failed to reach agreement on the Minsk II Accords, a peace plan brokered by the Germans and the French under which Ukraine would regain its sovereignty in the disputed eastern areas, including its control of the border with Russia, while the Donbass would be given full autonomy in a more decentralised Ukraine. All this time the West continued buying Russian fossil fuels. In ‘Londongrad’, a safe British haven for the oligarchs, law firms, bankers, tax consultants, art dealers and real estate agents carried on as usual as their money launderers."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"**The Russian economy had adapted to the sanctions and had largely recovered.** Thanks to sales of oil and gas, the country’s foreign currency reserves had grown to $500 billion, the fourth largest in the world. It gave Putin the war chest he would need to go on fighting in Ukraine while maintaining living standards in Russia. He was not afraid of more sanctions."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"**Putin saw the role of NATO in Ukraine as a direct military threat.** In an hour-long address to the Russian people on 21 February 2022, he claimed that Ukraine would ‘serve as an advanced bridgehead’ for NATO’s forces to attack Russia unless Moscow intervened. Under the guise of its training missions, NATO, he declared, was building bases in Ukrainian cities like Kharkiv, near the Russian border, from which its nuclear missiles could reach Moscow in a few minutes. **‘It is like a knife to our throat,’ he said.** From a Western point of view this seemed mad and paranoid. **NATO, after all, was a defensive alliance and had no reason to attack Russia. But as Putin saw it, it was the conclusion to be drawn from his reading of the history of Russia and Ukraine.**...**He demanded a written guarantee that Ukraine would never become part of NATO.**"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"Few people thought that he would launch a full-scale invasion...His decision surprised even senior Kremlin officials. **It must be explained by Putin’s isolation from reality. Terrified of Covid, he had spent the past two years in lockdown on his own in the Kremlin**. After twenty-two years in power, Putin had become an autocrat. No one dared to question him...His spies in Kiev had told him that Zelensky’s government would soon collapse: it had ruined the economy and lost the support of the Ukrainians, who would welcome Russia’s troops with open arms. They were too afraid to disillusion him by telling him the truth."*
    - Chapter 11 - *"How will this war end, and what sort of Russia will emerge from it? None of the possible scenarios bodes well for Russia or Ukraine...A military defeat for Russia is the first and least likely possibility...The second possible scenario is a stalemate, a permanently frozen conflict in Ukraine, with Russian troops in the Donbass and the east but neither side prepared to stop the fighting...A Russian victory of some kind is the most likely outcome of this war, given the resources at the Kremlin’s disposal. But what sort of victory can be achieved? Even if the Russians settle for the whole of the Donbass as their ‘victory’, they will still be left with the problem of Ukrainian insurgency and civil disobedience"*
    - Chapter 11 - *"**There were chapters in its history when Russia might have taken a more democratic path.** It had strong traditions of self-rule in its medieval city republics, in the peasant commune and the Cossack hetmanates and not least in the zemstvos, which might have laid the basis for a more inclusive form of national government. There were moments when its rulers edged towards a constitutional reform, only for their liberal initiatives to be overturned by the current of events pushing Russia closer to the tragedy of 1917. **And in the chaos of the revolution there were moments when the people were able to reshape the state in line with their old utopian dreams of social justice and freedom**."*

- [ ] [Orlando Figes, Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Natashas-Dance-Cultural-History-Russia/dp/0140297960)
    - Intro - *"For the past two hundred years the arts in Russia have served as an arena for political, philosophical and religious debate in the absence of a parliament or a free press...In a way that was extraordinary, if not unique to Russia, the country’s artistic energy was almost wholly given to the quest to grasp the idea of its nationality. Nowhere has the artist been more burdened with the task of moral leadership and national prophecy, nor more feared and persecuted by the state. Alienated from official Russia by their politics, and from peasant Russia by their education, Russia’s artists took it upon themselves to create a national community of values and ideas through literature and art. What did it mean to be a Russian? What was Russia’s place and mission in the world? And where was the true Russia? In Europe or in Asia? St Petersburg or Moscow? The Tsar’s empire or the muddy one-street village where Natasha’s ‘Uncle’ lived?"*
    - Intro - *"At its heart is an encounter between two entirely different worlds: the European culture of the upper classes and the Russian culture of the peasantry. The war of 1812 was the first moment when the two moved together in a national formation. Stirred by the patriotic spirit of the serfs, the aristocracy of Natasha’s generation began to break free from the foreign conventions of their society and search for a sense of nationhood based on ‘Russian’ principles."*
    - Intro - *"But the story which it tells is not meant to suggest that a single ‘national’ culture was the consequence. Russia was too complex, too socially divided, too politically diverse, too ill-defined geographically, and perhaps too big, for a single culture to be passed off as the national heritage."*
    - Intro - *"Russians have long complained that the Western public does not understand their culture, that Westerners see Russia from afar and do not want to know its inner subtleties, as they do with the culture of their own domain...Nothing has done more to obscure a proper understanding of Russia and its central place in European culture between 1812 and 1917. **The great cultural figures of the Russian tradition were not simply ‘Russians’, they were Europeans too, and the two identities were intertwined and mutually dependent in a variety of ways. However hard they might have tried, it was impossible for Russians such as these to suppress either part of their identity.**"*
    - Chapter 1 on "European Russia" - *"Few places could have been less suitable for the metropolis of Europe’s largest state. The network of small islands in the Neva’s boggy delta were overgrown with trees...it was not a place for human habitation, and even the few fishermen who ventured there in summer did not stay for long. In four months of furious activity, in which at least half the workforce died, 20,000 conscripts built the Peter and Paul Fortress, digging out the land with their bare hands, dragging logs and stones or carting them by back, and carrying the earth in the folds of their clothes. The sheer scale and tempo of construction was astonishing...Like the magic city of a Russian fairy tale, St Petersburg grew up with such fantastic speed, and everything about it was so brilliant and new, that it soon became a place enshrined in myth...A city built on water with imported stone, Petersburg defied the natural order. The famous granite of its river banks came from... The achievement of transporting such quantities of stone has been surpassed only by the building of the pyramids."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"Petersburg did not grow up like other towns. Neither commerce nor geopolitics can account for its development. Rather it was built as a work of art...‘here everything has been created for visual perception’. Petersburg was conceived as a composition of natural elements -water, stone and sky...Peter was eclectic in his architectural tastes and borrowed what he liked from Europe’s capitals. **Petersburg differs from all other European towns by being like them all. Yet, despite its obvious borrowings, the city had its own distinctive character, a product of its open setting between sea and sky, the grandeur of its scale, and the unity of its architectural ensembles, which lent the city a unique artistic harmony. Whereas older European cities had been built over several centuries, ending up at best as collections of beautiful buildings in diverse period styles, Petersburg was completed within fifty years and according to a single set of principles.**"*
    - Chapter 1 - *"St Petersburg was more than a city. It was a vast, almost Utopian, project of cultural engineering to reconstruct the Russian as a European man. In Notes from Underground (1864) Dostoevsky called it **‘the most abstract and intentional city in the whole world'**."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"The dominance of the Church hindered the development in Muscovy of the secular art forms that had taken shape in Europe since the Renaissance. Instead, **the icon was the focal point of Muscovy’s religious way of life**. It was an artefact of daily ritual as much as it was a creative work of art. Icons were encountered everywhere - not just in homes and churches but in shops and offices or in wayside shrines. There was next to nothing to connect the icon to the European tradition of secular painting that had its origins in the Renaissance."*
    - [The Bronze Horseman (poem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronze_Horseman_(poem))
    - Chapter 1 - *"Everything in the new capital was intended to compel the Russians to adopt a more European way of life...Here were the roots of the nineteenth-century myth of the ‘unreal city’ - alien and threatening to the Russian way of life - which was to play a central role in Russian literature and art."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"The Tatars left a profound trace on boyar customs and habits. For over three hundred years, the period of the Renaissance in the West, Russia was cut off from European civilization. The country which emerged from the Mongol period was far more inward-looking than it had been at the start of the thirteenth century, when Kievan Rus’, the loose confederation of principalities which constituted the first Russian state, had been intimately linked with Byzantium....The Russian nobleman of the Muscovite era was not a landed lord in the European sense. He was a servant of the Crown."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"His life was regulated by the archaic rituals of the Church - its calendar arranged to count the years from the notional creation of the world (with the birth of Adam) in 5509 bc With Peter’s reformation of society, the nobleman became the agency, and his palace the arena, of Russia’s introduction to European ways...Peter the Great introduced the Western (Julian) calendar in 1700. But by 1752 the rest of Europe had changed to the Gregorian calendar - thirteen days ahead of the Julian calendar (which remained in force in Russia until 1918)."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"Peter established a Table of Ranks that ordered the nobles according to their office (rather than their birth) and allowed commoners to be given noble status for their service to the state. This almost military ordering of the nobles had a deep and lasting effect on their way of life. The Russian nobleman was obsessed by rank.*"

    - Chapter 1 - *"Praskovya was blessed with a rare intelligence and strength of character. She was the finest singer in the Russia of her day, literate and conversant with several languages. Yet until a year before her death she remained a serf. What were her feelings? How did she respond to the prejudice she met? How did she reconcile her deep religious faith, her acceptance of the sin of sexual relations outside marriage, with her feelings for the count? It is very seldom that one gets the chance to hear the confession of a serf.*
    - Chapter 1 - *"The musical life of eighteenth-century Russia was dominated by the court and by small private theatres such as Sheremetev’s. Public theatres, which were long-established in the towns of western Europe, did not really feature in the cultural life of Russia until the 1780s...In 1762, the Empress liberated the nobility from compulsory service to the state. She wanted her nobility to resemble a European one. It was a turning point in the cultural history of the aristocracy. Relieved of their stately duties, many noblemen retired to the country and developed their estates. The decades following the emancipation of the nobility were the golden age of the pleasure palace, with galleries for art, exquisite parks and gardens, orchestras and theatres appearing for the first time in the Russian countryside. The estate became much more than just an economic unit or living space. It became an island of European culture on Russian peasant soil...The Russian ballet was born at Kuskovo. So, too, was the Russian opera."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"Berezovsky was elected to the Accademia Philharmonica in Bologna. He returned to Russia in 1775 and, two years later, committed suicide. Tarkovsky’s film Nostalgia (1983) is a commentary on exile as told through the story of Berezovsky’s life."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"The aristocracy of eighteenth-century Russia was aware of acting out its life as if upon a stage. The Russian nobleman was not born a ‘European’ and European manners were not natural to him. He had to learn such manners, as he learned a foreign language, in a ritualized form by conscious imitation of the West. Peter the Great began it all -reinventing himself and his aristocracy in the European mould. The first thing he did on his return from Europe, in 1698, was to order all the boyars to give up their kaftans for Western codes of dress. In a symbolic rupture with the past, he forbade them to wear beards, traditionally seen as a sign of holiness, and himself took the shears to reluctant courtiers...“In the Orthodox belief the beard was a mark of God and Christ (both were depicted wearing beards) and a mark of manhood (animals had whiskers). Because of Peter’s prohibition, wearing beards became a sign of ‘Russianness’ and of resistance to his reforms."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"The European Russian had a split identity. His mind was a state divided into two. On one level he was conscious of acting out his life according to prescribed European conventions; yet on another plane his inner life was swayed by Russian customs and sensibilities...**the European Russian was a ‘European’ on the public stage and a ‘Russian’ in those moments of his private life when, without even thinking, he did things in a way that only Russians did. This was the legacy from his ancestors which no European influence could totally erase. It enabled a countess like Natasha to dance the Russian dance. In every Russian aristocrat, however European he may have become, there was a discreet and instinctive empathy with the customs and beliefs, the habits and the rhythms of Russian peasant life.**"*
    - Chapter 1 - *"The whole idea of a European education was to make the Russian feel as much at home in Paris as in Petersburg. **This education made for a certain cosmopolitanism, which was one of Russia’s most enduring cultural strengths. It gave the educated classes a sense that they belonged to a broader European civilization, and this was the key to the supreme achievements of their national culture in the nineteenth century.** Pushkin, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Tchaikovsky, Diaghilev and Stravinsky - **they all combined their Russianness with a European cultural identity**...**Yet this sense of being part of Europe also made for divided souls. ‘We Russians have two fatherlands: Russia and Europe,’ Dostoevsky wrote.** Alexander Herzen was a typical example of this Westernized elite. After meeting him in Paris Dostoevsky said that he did not emigrate - he was born an emigrant. The nineteenth-century writer Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin explained this condition of internal exile well. ‘In Russia,’ he recalled of the 1840s, ‘we existed only in a factual sense, or as it was said then, we had a “mode of life”. We went to the office, we wrote letters to our relatives, we dined in restaurants, we conversed with each other and so on. But spiritually we were all inhabitants of France. **For these European Russians, then, ‘Europe’ was not just a place. It was a region of the mind which they inhabited through their education, their language, their religion and their general attitudes.**"*
    - Chapter 1 - *"It was a common paradox that the most refined and cultured Russians could speak only the peasant form of Russian which they had learnt from the servants as children...“This neglect of the Russian language was most pronounced and persistent in the highest echelons of the aristocracy, which had always been the most Europeanized...Tolstoy had no contact with Russian literature before he went to school at the age of nine. Turgenev only learned to read and write in Russian thanks to the efforts of his father’s serf valet...The Orthodox religion was equally remote from the consciousness of the Westernized elites. For religion played but a minor role in the upbringing of the aristocracy."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"Set against this domination by Europe, satires such as Kniazhnin’s and Kheraskov’s began to define the Russian character in terms which were distinct from the values of the West. These writers set up the antithesis between foreign artifice and native truth, European reason and the Russian heart or ‘soul’, that would form the basis of the national narrative in the nineteenth century. At the heart of this discourse was the old romantic ideal of the native soil - of a pure ‘organic’ Russia uncorrupted by civilization. St Petersburg was all deceit and vanity, a narcissistic dandy constantly observing its own reflection in the Neva river. The real Russia was in the provinces, a place without pretensions or alien conventions, where simple ‘Russian’ virtues were preserved...Even Karamzin, a Westernist who was certainly not nostalgic for the old nobility, idealized the ‘virtuous and simple life of our ancestors’, when ‘the Russians were real Russians. **'Have a heart, have a soul, and you’ll always be a man. Everything else is fashion.'** The idea of a truly Russian self that had been concealed and suppressed by the alien conventions of Petersburg society became commonplace."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"**..the main Russian trait was spontaneity. In foreign lands all goes to a plan, Words are weighed, steps measured. But among us Russians there is fiery life, Our speech is thunder and sparks fly.**"...Central to this cult of simple peasant life was the notion of its moral purity. The radical satirist Alexander Radishchev was the first to argue that the nation’s highest virtues were contained in the culture of its humblest folk."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"The projection of Russia into Europe had always been the raison d’etre of St Petersburg. It was not simply Peter’s ‘window on to Europe’ but an open doorway through which Europe entered Russia and the Russians made their entry to the world. For Russia’s educated elites Europe was more than a tourist destination. It was a cultural ideal, the spiritual source of their civilization, and to travel to it was to make a pilgrimage...These Travel Letters were the first attempt by a Russian writer to define Russia’s spiritual traditions as different from, and indeed superior to, those of the West...In his early letters from abroad Fonvizin depicted all the nations as the same. ‘I have seen that in any land there is much more bad than good, that people are people everywhere, that intelligence is rare and idiots abound in every country, and that, in a word, our country is no worse than any other. Worthwhile people form a single nation among themselves, regardless of the country they come from'. In the course of his second trip...he concluded, Europe was a long way from the ideal the Russians imagined it to be, and it was time to acknowledge that ‘life with us is better'...The idea that the West was morally corrupt was echoed by virtually every..Dostoevsky placed it at the heart of their messianic visions of Russia’s destiny to save the fallen West."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"**The Russians were uncertain about their place in Europe (they still are), and that ambivalence is a vital key to their cultural history and identity. Living on the margins of the continent, they have never been quite sure if their destiny is there. Are they of the West or of the East?** Peter made his people face the West and imitate its ways...If Russia could not become a part of ‘Europe’, **it should take more pride in being ‘different’**. In this nationalist mythology the **‘Russian soul’ was awarded a higher moral value than the material achievements of the West**. It had a Christian mission to save the world."*
    - Chapter 1 - *"Russia’s idealization of Europe was profoundly shaken by the French Revolution of 1789...In this search for a new life on ‘Russian principles’ the Enlightenment ideal of a universal culture was finally abandoned for the national way. ‘Let us Russians be Russians, let us remain patriots and retain the character of our ancestors'."*
    - Chapter 2 "Children of 1812" - *"For princes like Volkonsky it must have been a shock to discover that the peasants were the nation’s patriots: as noblemen they had been brought up to revere the aristocracy as the ‘true sons of the fatherland’. Yet for some, like Volkonsky, this revelation was a sign of hope as well - the hope that in its serfs the nation had its future citizens. These liberal noblemen would stand up for ‘the nation’ and the ‘people’s cause’, in what would become known as the Decembrist uprising on 14 December 1825....he compared the serfs (who were ‘ready to defend their motherland with scythes’) with the aristocracy (who ‘ran off to their estates’ as the French approached Moscow). Many officers came to recognize the peasant’s moral worth. ‘Every day, I meet peasant soldiers who are just as good and rational as any nobleman. These simple men have not yet been corrupted by the absurd conventions of our society, and they have their own moral ideas which are just as good.'...**But in the war they were suddenly thrown into the peasants’ world: they lived in their villages, they shared their food and fears with the common soldiers, and at times, when they were wounded or lost without supplies, they depended on those soldiers’ know-how to survive. As their respect for the common people grew, they adopted a more humanitarian approach to the men under their command.**...After the war these democratic officers returned to their estates with a new sense of commitment to their serfs."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"**For some officers it was not enough to identify themselves with the common people’s cause: they wanted to take on the identity of common men themselves.** They Russified their dress and behaviour in an effort to move closer to the soldiers in the ranks. **It was a declaration of their nationality.**...The young officers who came back from Europe were virtually unrecognizable to their parents. The Russia they returned to in 1815 was much the same as the Russia they had left. But they had greatly changed...But they differed from their elders in far more than their manners and dress. They also differed from them in their artistic tastes and interests, their politics and general attitudes: they turned their backs on the frivolous diversions of the ballroom and immersed themselves in serious pursuits...**The alienation felt by these young men from their parents’ generation and society was common to all ‘children of 1812’, poets and philosophers as well as officers. It left a profound imprint on the cultural life of Russia in the nineteenth century.**...It is hard to overstate the extent to which the Russian cultural renaissance of the nineteenth century entailed a revolt against the service ethic of the eighteenth century...‘Service now in Russia is the same as life’, wrote one official in the 1810s: ‘we leave our offices as if we are going to our graves."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"There was a cult of brotherhood in the Decembrist camp. It evolved into the cult of the collective which would become so important to the political life of the Russian intelligentsia."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Through such bonds young officers began to break away from the rigid hierarchies of the service state. They felt themselves to belong to a new community - a ‘nation’, if you will - of patriotic virtue and fraternity where the noble and the peasant lived in harmony. The nineteenth-century quest for Russian nationhood began in the ranks of 1812. This outlook was shared by all the cultural figures in the orbit of the Decembrists: not just by those in its leading ranks, but by those, more numerous, who sympathized with the Decembrists without actively engaging in plans for a rebellion (‘Decembrists without December’)...**The duty of the poet, as they saw it, was to be a citizen, to dedicate himself to the national cause. Like all the men of 1812, they saw their work as part of a democratic mission to learn about and educate the common people so as to unite society on Russian principles. They rejected the Enlightenment idea that ‘all the nations should become the same’ and, in the words of one critic, called on ‘all our writers to reflect the character of the Russian folk'**."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Yet, for all his Western inclinations, Pushkin was a poet with a Russian voice...Like the officers of 1812, he felt that the landowner’s obligation as the guardian of his serfs was more important than his duty to the state...**He felt this obligation as a writer, too, and looked to shape a written language that could speak to everyone. The Decembrists made this a central part of their philosophy. They called for laws to be written in a language ‘that every citizen can understand’.**..Pushkin’s verse was the first to make this link. It spoke to the widest readership, to the literate peasant and the prince, in a common Russian tongue."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"The Emperor appointed his adviser Mikhail Speransky to draw up plans for a constitution that was largely based on the Code Napoleon. Had Speransky got his way, Russia would have moved toward becoming a constitutional monarchy governed by a law-based bureaucratic state...Count Orlov, a leading member of the Union, organized a brave petition to the Tsar calling for the abolition of serfdom...Pestel was the most radical of the Decembrist leaders. Charismatic and domineering, he was clearly influenced by the Jacobins."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Five hundred Decembrists were arrested and interrogated, but most of them were released in the next few weeks, once they had provided evidence for the prosecution of the main leaders. **At their trial, the first show trial in Russian history**, 121 conspirators were found guilty of treason, stripped of their noble titles and sent as convict labourers to Siberia."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Of all the Decembrists, none was closer to the court than Volkonsky...Nicholas was harsh on Volkonsky. Perhaps he felt betrayed by the man he had once played with as a boy...Yet Maria chose to share her husband’s fate. She gave up everything and followed Sergei to Siberia. Warned by the Tsar that she would have to leave her son behind, Maria wrote to him: ‘My son is happy but my husband is unhappy and he needs me more.' Maria acted out of her sense of duty as a wife. Such a sense of duty was ingrained in Maria by her noble upbringing...Alexandra Muraviev, the wife of the Decembrist Nikita Muraviev, who came from a rather less aristocratic background...It was romantic love that compelled Alexandra to give up everything for a life of penal exile in Siberia - she even claimed that it was her ‘sin’ to ‘love my Nikitishchina more than I love God’.”*

    - Chapter 2 - *"Siberia brought the exiles together. It showed them how to live truly by the principles of communality and self-sufficiency which they had so admired in the peasantry...Family relations became closer, too. Gone were the servants who had taken over child care for the noble family of the eighteenth century. The Siberian exiles brought up their own children and taught them all they knew...For the adults, too, exile meant a simpler and more ‘Russian’ way of life...And all of them were forced, for the first time in their lives, to become fluent in their native tongue...The urge to lead a simple peasant life was shared by many noblemen (Volkonsky’s distant cousin, Leo Tolstoy, comes to mind). This very ‘Russian’ quest for a ‘Life of Truth’ was more profound than the romantic search for a ‘spontaneous’ or ‘organic’ existence which motivated cultural movements elsewhere in Europe. At its heart was a religious vision of the ‘Russian soul’ that encouraged national prophets - from the Slavophiles in the 1830s to the Populists in the 1870s - to  worship at the altar of the peasantry. The Slavophiles believed in the moral superiority of the Russian peasant commune over modern Western ways and argued for a return to these principles. The Populists were convinced that the egalitarian customs of the commune could serve as a model for the socialist and democratic reorganization of society; they turned to the peasants in the hope of finding allies for their revolutionary cause. For all these intellectuals, Russia was revealed, as a messianic truth, in the customs and beliefs of its peasantry...'There is more honesty and integrity of feeling in the peasants of Siberia.'...Soviet period, when the Decembrists were heroized."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Like all the Decembrist exiles, **Volkonsky saw Siberia as a land of democratic hope. Here, it seemed to them, was a young and childlike Russia, primordial and raw, rich in natural resources. It was a frontier land whose pioneering farmers were not crushed by serfdom or the state (for there were few serf owners in Siberia), so that they had retained an independent spirit and resourcefulness, a natural sense of justice and equality, from which the old Russia might renew itself. The youthful energy of its unbridled peasants contained Russia’s democratic potential.** Hence the Decembrists immersed themselves in the study of Siberian folklore and history...**'Manual labour is such a healthy thing. And it is a joy when it feeds one’s family and is of benefit to other people too'.**"*
    - Chapter 2 - *"This extraordinary ability to enter into the world of the common people requires comment. Tolstoy, after all, never really managed it, even though he tried for nearly fifty years. Perhaps Volkonsky’s success is explained by his long experience of addressing the peasant soldiers in his regiments. Or perhaps, once the conventions of his European culture were stripped away, he could draw on the Russian customs he had grown up with."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"For Shishkov the influence of French was to blame for the decline of the Orthodox religion and the old patriarchal moral code: the Russian way of life was being undermined by a cultural invasion from the West...It became a fashion for the sons of noblemen to learn to read and write their native tongue...**Without this growing Russian readership the literary renaissance of the nineteenth century would have been inconceivable.**..**These disputes over language involved a broader conflict about ‘Russia’ and what it should be - a follower of Europe or a unique culture of its own.**..In the eighteenth century the use of French and Russian had demarcated two entirely separate spheres: French the sphere of thought and sentiment, Russian the sphere of daily life."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"In contrast to the formal classicism of the urban palace, the dacha was constructed in a simple Russian style...The dacha was a place for Russian relaxations and pursuits."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"A fashion for the ‘natural’ look took hold of noblewomen in the 1820s. The new ideal of beauty focused on a vision of the purity of the female figures of antiquity and the Russian peasantry...Women took to wearing cotton clothes. They dressed their hair in a simple style and rejected heavy make-up for the pale complexion favoured by this cult of unadorned Nature. The turn toward Nature and simplicity was widespread throughout Europe from the final decades of the eighteenth century...**But in Russia the fashion for the natural had an extra, national dimension. It was linked to the idea that one had to strip away the external layers of cultural convention to reveal the Russian personality.**"*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Pushkin’s masterpiece is, among many other things, a subtle exploration of the complex Russian-European consciousness that typified the aristocracy in the age of 1812. The literary critic Vissarion Belinsky said that Eugene Onegin was an encyclopaedia of Russian life, and Pushkin himself, in its final stanzas, developed the idea of the novel as life’s book. In no other work can one see so clearly the visceral influence of cultural convention on the Russian sense of self. In many ways, indeed, the novel’s central subject is the complex interplay between life and art....She is torn between the gravitational fields of Europe and Russia...We see in her the dense weave of cultural influences. These lines are adapted from a song well known among the Russian folk. Thought in Pushkin’s time to have been written by Peter the Great, it was translated into French by Pushkin’s own uncle. Tatiana could have read it in an old issue of Mercure de France. But she could also have heard it from her peasant nurse. **It is a perfect illustration of the complex intersections between European and native Russian culture during Pushkin’s age.**”*

    - Chapter 2 - *"As far as Pushkin was concerned, Russia was a part of Western and world culture, and it did not make his ‘folk tales’ any less authentic if he combined all these sources in literary re-creations of the Russian style. How ironic, then, that Soviet nationalists regarded Pushkin’s stories as direct expressions of the Russian folk....During his childhood Gogol fell in love with the earthy idiom of the local peasantry. He loved their songs and dances, their terrifying tales and comic stories, from which his own fantastic tales of Petersburg would later take their cue...More and more, common speech entered literature, as writers like Gogol began to assimilate the spoken idiom to their written form...Russian music also found its national voice through the assimilation of folk song....Western composers also turned to it for exotic Russian colour and themes russes...In painting, too, there was a new approach to the Russian peasantry...Yet, in the wake of 1812, a different picture of the peasantry emerged - one that emphasized their heroic strength and human dignity....He conveyed the vastness of the Russian land by lowering the horizon to enhance the immensity of the sky over its flat open spaces - a technique derived from icon painting....No other painter brought such realism to his depictions of agricultural life."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Compared to their parents, the Russian nobles who grew up after 1812 put a higher valuation on childhood....This nostalgia for the age of childhood merged with a new reverence for the Russian customs which they had known as children through their fathers’ household serfs. In the eighteenth century the aristocracy had seen childhood as a preparation for the adult world...Yet there were bonds of affection and respect between many noble children and their serfs...Herzen wrote that there existed ‘a feudal bond of affection’ between the noble family and its household serfs. We have lost sight of this bond in the histories of oppression that have shaped our views of serfdom since 1917. But it can be found in the childhood memoirs of the aristocracy; it lives on in every page of nineteenth-century literature; and its spirit can be felt in Russian paintings...The nostalgia of the nobleman for his childhood was associated with the warmth and tenderness of his relationship with these people."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"...the nanny was the child’s main source of love and emotional security...How many loyal and loving Russian nannies have guarded and inspired the lives of their children, leaving an indelible impression upon them...Time and time again these memoirists stress that it was their nanny who taught them how to love and how to live. For some, the key was their nanny’s innate kindness, which awoke their moral sensibilities; for others, it was her religious faith, which brought them into contact with the spiritual world...It was not at all unusual for grown men and women to remain in frequent contact with their former nannies; indeed, for them to provide for them in their old age...Pushkin loved his nanny more than anyone...The nanny was an almost sacred figure in that cult of childhood which the Russian gentry made its own. **No other culture has been so sentimental or quite so obsessed about childhood..The essence of this cult was a hypertrophied sense of loss - loss of the ancestral home, loss of the mother or the nanny’s tender care, loss of the peasant, child-like Russia contained in fairy tales.**."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"..History of the Russian State (1818-26). **Karamzin’s masterpiece was the first truly national history - not just in the sense that it was the first by a Russian, but also in the sense that it rendered Russia’s past as a national narrative.** Previous histories of Russia had been arcane chronicles of monasteries and saints, patriotic propaganda, or heavy tomes of documents compiled by German scholars, unread and unreadable. But Karamzin’s History had a literary quality that made its twelve large volumes a nationwide success. It combined careful scholarship with the narrative techniques of a novelist...**'Three thousand copies were sold within a month - something unprecedented in our country. Everyone began to read the history of their country. It was a revelation. You could say that Karamzin discovered ancient Russia as Columbus discovered America.'**...**The victory of 1812 had encouraged a new interest and pride in Russia’s past. People who had been raised on the old conviction that there was no history before the reign of Peter the Great began to look back to the distant past for the sources of their country’s unexpected strengths.**...**History became the arena for all those troubling questions about Russia’s nature and its destiny. 'We interrogate our past for an explanation of our present and a hint of our future.’** This historical obsession was reinforced by the failure of the Decembrists. **If Russia was no longer to pursue the Western path of history toward a modern constitutional state, as the Decembrists and their supporters had hoped, what then was its proper destiny?** This was the question posed by Pyotr Chaadaev"*
    - Chapter 2 - *"**The horrors of the French Revolution had led the Slavophiles to reject the universal culture of the Enlightenment and to emphasize instead those indigenous traditions that distinguished Russia from the West. This search for a more ‘Russian’ way of life was a common response to the debacle of 1825. Once it became clear that Russia would diverge from the Western path, European Russians began to explore - and find virtue in - those parts of Russian culture that were different from the West.** They idealized the common folk (narod) as the true bearer of the national character...As devout upholders of the Orthodox ideal, they maintained that the Russian was defined by Christian sacrifice and humility. This was the foundation of the spiritual community (sobornost’) in which, they imagined, the squire and his serfs were bound together by their patriarchal customs and Orthodox beliefs.."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Karamzin’s History was the opening statement in a long debate on Russia’s past and future that would run right through its culture in the nineteenth century. Karamzin’s own work was squarely situated in the monarchist tradition, which portrayed the Tsarist state and its noble servitors as a force for progress and enlightenment...The Tsar and his nobles initiated change, while ‘the people remain silent’...Pushkin shared Karamzin’s statist view of Russian history -at least in his later years, after the collapse of his republican convictions in 1825. In The History of Pugachev, Pushkin emphasized the need for enlightened monarchy to protect the nation from the elemental violence of the Cossack rebel leader Pugachev and his peasant followers....Dostoevsky shared this view. 'The Russians were a people devoted to sacrifice, seeking truth and knowing where truth can be found, as honest and pure in heart as one of their high ideals, the epic hero Ilia Muromets, whom they cherish as a saint'."*
    - [Ilya Muromets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Muromets)
    - Chapter 2 - *"In contrast to these views was the democratic trend of Russian history advanced by the Decembrists and their followers. They stressed the rebellious and freedom-loving spirit of the Russian people and idealized the medieval republics of Novgorod and Pskov, and the Cossack revolts of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, including Pugachev’s. **They believed that the common people had always been the (hidden) moving force of history - a theory largely shaped by their observation of the peasant soldiers in the war of 1812. In response to Karamzin’s famous motto ‘The history of the nation belongs to the Tsar’, the Decembrist historian Nikita Muraviev began his study with the fighting words: ‘History belongs to the people.'**."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"The origins of Russia was a major battlefield in this war between historians. Monarchists subscribed to the so-called Norman theory, which maintained that the first ruling princes had arrived in Russia from Scandinavia (in the ninth century) by invitation from the warring Slavic tribes. The only real evidence for this argument was the **Primary Chronicle - an eleventh-century account of the founding of the Kievan state in 862** - which had probably been written to justify what actually amounted to the Scandinavian conquest of Russia. The theory became increasingly untenable as nineteenth-century archaeologists drew attention to the advanced culture of the Slavic tribes in southern Russia...**Yet the Norman theory was a good foundation myth for the defenders of autocracy - supposing, as it did, that without a monarchy the Russians were incapable of governance.** In Karamzin’s words, before the establishment of princely rule, Russia had been nothing but an ‘empty space’ with ‘wild and warring tribes, living on a level with the beasts and birds'. Against that the democrats maintained that the Russian state had evolved spontaneously from the native customs of the Slavic tribes."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Another battlefield was medieval Novgorod - the greatest monument to Russian liberty and, in the Decembrist view, historic proof of the people’s right to rule themselves...The Decembrists made a cult of the city republic. As a symbol of the people’s long-lost freedoms, they saw its veche, or assembly, as a sacred legacy connecting Russia to the democratic traditions of ancient Greece and Rome....The monarchist perception of medieval Novgorod formed a stark contrast. According to Karamzin, Moscow’s conquest of the city was a necessary step towards the creation of a unitary state, and was recognized as such by its citizens. This submission was a sign of the Russian people’s wisdom, in Karamzin’s view: they recognized that freedom was worth nothing without order and security...Karamzin’s version was almost certainly closer to the historical truth than the Decembrists’ vision."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"**The war of 1812 was itself a battlefield for these competing myths of Russian history. This was shown by its commemoration in the nineteenth“century. For the Decembrists, 1812 was a people’s war. It was the point at which the Russians came of age, the moment when they passed from childhood into adult citizens, and with their triumphant entry into Europe, they should have joined the family of European states. But for the defenders of the status quo, the war symbolized the holy triumph of the Russian autocratic principle, which alone saved Europe from Napoleon.**...“**hroughout the nineteenth century these two images of 1812 - as  a national liberation or imperial salvation - continued to compete for the public meaning of the war.** On the one side was Tolstoy’s War and Peace, a truly national drama which tells its history from the viewpoint of the noble and the serf. On the other were the monuments in stone, the triumphant arches and gates of victory in the pompous ‘Empire style’ that trumpeted Russia’s imperial might; or the sound of all those cannons in Tchaikovsky’s Overture of 1812."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"The fiftieth anniversary of 1812 coincided with the millennium of the Russian state in 1862...By merging these three anniversaries, the Romanov dynasty was attempting to reinvent itself as a national institution, consecrated by the holy victory of 1812, and one as old as the Russian state itself."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"A distant cousin of the Decembrist, Tolstoy was extremely proud of his Volkonsky heritage. Having lost his mother at the age of three, he had more than just an academic interest in researching the background of her family: for him, it was an emotional necessity. Sergei Volkonsky was a childhood hero of Tolstoy’s and in time he became the inspiration for Prince Andrei Bolkonsky in War and Peace. Much of Tolstoy’s commitment to the peasants, not to mention his desire to become one himself, was inspired by the example of his exiled relative...**It is generally supposed that Conservatives are old people, and that those in favour of change are the young. That is not quite correct. Usually Conservatives are young people: those who want to live but who do not think about how to live, and have not time to think, and therefore take as a model for themselves a way of life that they have seen.**...War and Peace was originally conceived as a ‘Decembrist novel’, loosely based on the life story of Sergei Volkonsky. But the more the writer researched into the Decembrists, the more he realized that their intellectual roots lay in the war of 1812...Volkonsky’s release from exile was one of the first acts of the new Tsar...Volkonsky was a living connection between the Decembrists and the Populists...Volkonsky himself remained true to the ideals of 1812. He continued to reject the values of the bureaucratic state and the aristocracy and, in the spirit of the Decembrists, he continued to uphold the civic obligation to live an honest life in the service of the people, who embodied the nation...Volkonsky’s notion of the Fatherland was intimately linked with his idea of the Tsar: he saw the sovereign as a symbol of Russia. Throughout his life he remained a monarchist - so much so indeed that when he heard about the death of Nicholas I, the Tsar who had sent him into exile thirty years before, Volkonsky broke down and cried like a child...But Volkonsky’s tears were tears for Russia, too: he saw the Tsar as the Empire’s single unifying force and was afraid for his country now that the Tsar was dead."*
    - Chapter 2 -*"Yet Russia’s defeat made more likely Volkonsky’s second hope: the emancipation of the serfs. **The new Tsar, Alexander II, was another child of 1812.** He had been educated by the liberal poet Vasily Zhukovsky, who had been appointed tutor to the court in 1817. In 1822 Zhukovsky had set free the serfs on his estate. **His humanism had a major influence on the future Tsar. The defeat in the Crimean War had persuaded Alexander that Russia could not compete with the Western powers until it swept aside its old serf economy and modernized itself.** The gentry had very little idea how to make a profit from their estates. Most of them knew next to nothing about agriculture or accounting...**The Tsar believed that the emancipation was a necessary measure to prevent a revolution from below. The soldiers who had fought in the Crimean War had been led to expect their freedom**....Like Volkonsky, Alexander was convinced that emancipation was, in Volkonsky’s words, a ‘question of justice… a moral and a Christian obligation, for every citizen who loves his Fatherland’. As the Decembrist explained in a letter to Pushchin, **the abolition of serfdom was ‘the least the state could do to recognize the sacrifice the peasantry has made in the last two wars: it is time to recognize that the Russian peasant is a citizen as well.**...Thus, in effect, the serfs bought their freedom by paying off their masters’ debts. The redemption payments became increasingly difficult to collect, not least because the peasantry regarded them as unjust from the start. They were finally cancelled in 1905."*
    - Chapter 2 - *"Volkonsky’s programme was not dissimilar to the land reforms of Pyotr Stolypin, the Prime Minister and last reformist hope of Tsarist Russia between 1906 and 1911. **Had such a programme been implemented in 1861, Russia might have become a more prosperous place.**...Freedom of a sort, however limited it may have been in practice, had at last been granted to the mass of the people, and there were grounds to hope for a national rebirth, and reconciliation between the landowners and the peasantry. **The liberal spirit of 1812 had triumphed in the end - or so it seemed.**."*
    - Chapter 3 "Moscow! Moscow!" - *"**The French found Moscow empty.** The mass exodus had begun in August, when news of the defeat at Smolensk had arrived in Moscow, and it reached fever pitch after Borodino, when Kutuzov fell back to the outskirts of the city and finally decided to abandon it. The rich (like the Rostovs in War and Peace) packed up their belongings and left by horse and cart for their country houses. The poor walked, carrying their children, their chickens crated on to carts, their cows following behind...**The fires had been ordered by Count Rostopchin, the city’s governor, as an act of sacrifice to rob the French of supplies and force them to retreat. Soon the whole of Moscow was engulfed in flames.** ...Napoleon was forced to flee...**All the time he expressed his outrage, and his admiration, at the Russian sacrifice. ‘What a people!'**."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**Tolstoy wrote in War and Peace that every Russian felt Moscow to be a mother. There was a sense in which it was the nation’s ‘home’, even for members of the most Europeanized elite of Petersburg. Moscow was a symbol of the old Russia, the place where ancient Russian customs were preserved.**...After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Moscow saw itself as the last surviving centre of the Orthodox religion, as the heir to Rome and Byzantium, and as such the saviour of mankind. Moscow’s princes claimed the imperial title ‘Tsar’ (a Russian derivation of ‘Caesar’); they added the double-headed eagle of the Byzantine emperors to the figure of St George on their coat of arms...The union of Moscow and Orthodoxy was cemented in the churches and the monasteries, with their icons and their frescoes, which remain the glory of medieval Russian art...The Old Believers pinned their faith on Moscow’s messianic destiny as the Third Rome, the last true seat of Orthodoxy after the fall of Constantinople...They regarded Peter as the Antichrist - his city on the Baltic as a kingdom of the Devil and apocalypse."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"After 1812 the centre of the city was finally rebuilt in the European style...Every noble family felt instinctively the need to reconstruct their old ancestral home, so Moscow was rebuilt with fantastic speed...**Yet in all this frenzy of construction there was never slavish imitation of the West. Moscow always mixed the European with its own distinctive style. Classical facades were softened by the use of warm pastel colours, large round bulky forms and Russian ornament. The overall effect was to radiate an easygoing charm that was entirely absent from the cold austerity and imperial grandeur of St Petersburg. Petersburg’s style was dictated by the court and by European fashion; Moscow’s was set more by the Russian provinces.**...Moscow, in this sense, was the cultural capital of the Russian provinces. But oriental customs and colours and motifs were also to be seen on Moscow’s streets. The poet Konstantin Batiushkov saw the **city as a ‘bizarre mix’ of East and West. It was an ‘amazing and incomprehensible confluence of superstition and magnificence, ignorance and enlightenment’**, which led him to the disturbing conclusion that Peter had ‘accomplished a great deal - but he did not finish anything'...Napoleon thought its churches were like mosques...Moscow’s rebirth was soon mythologized as a national renaissance, a conscious rejection of the European culture of St Petersburg in favour of a return to the ancient native traditions of Muscovy."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**The opposition between Moscow and St Petersburg was fundamental to the ideological arguments between the Westernizers and the Slavophiles about Russia’s cultural destiny. The Westernizers held up Petersburg as the model of their Europe-led ideas for Russia, while the Slavophiles idealized Moscow as a centre of the ancient Russian way of life.**...the Kremlin walls so firmly rooted to the ground that they seemed to grow from it. The city’s tightly knit communities, its homely character, symbolized the familial spirit of old Rus’. **Moscow’s mythic self-image was all about its ‘Russian character’.**..**The Moscow way of life was more provincial, it was closer to the habits of the Russian people than the gentry’s way of life in Petersburg.**."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**Many Russians felt that Moscow was a place where they could be more ‘Russian’, more at ease with themselves. Here was a city that reflected their spontaneous and relaxed character. One that shared their love of the good life. ‘Petersburg is our head, Moscow is our heart’, went a Russian proverb.** Gogol drew the contrast in another way: **Petersburg is an accurate, punctual kind of person, a perfect German, and he looks at everything in a calculated way. Before he gives a party, he will look into his accounts. Moscow is a Russian nobleman, and if he’s going to have a good time, he’ll go all the way until he drops, and he won’t worry about how much he’s got in his pockets. Moscow does not like halfway measures… Petersburg likes to tease Moscow for his awkwardness and lack of taste. Moscow reproaches Petersburg because he doesn’t know how to speak Russian… Russia needs Moscow, Petersburg needs Russia.**"*
    - Chapter 3 - *"The idea of Moscow as a ‘Russian’ city developed from the notion of St Petersburg as a foreign civilization. The literary conception of St Petersburg as an alien and an artificial place became commonplace after 1812, as the romantic yearning for a more authentically national way of life seized hold of the literary imagination. But the foreign character of Petersburg had always been a part of its popular mythology. From the moment it was built, traditionalists attacked it for its European ways....And so the myth of Petersburg took shape - an unreal city that was alien to Russia, a supernatural realm of fantasies and ghosts, a kingdom of oppression and apocalypse. Pushkin’s Bronze Horseman - subtitled a ‘Tale of Petersburg’ - was the founding text of this literary myth...The huge granite rock - so wild in its appearance - on which the statue stood, was itself an emblem of the tragic struggle between man and nature...flooding was a constant threat to Petersburg...The poem can be read in many different ways - as a clash between the state and the individual, progress and tradition, the city and nature, the autocracy and the people"*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**For the Slavophiles, Peter’s city was a symbol of the catastrophic rupture with Holy Rus’; for the Westerners, a progressive sign of Russia’s Europeanization. For some, it was the triumph of a civilization, the conquering of nature by order and reason; for others, it was a monstrous artifice, an empire built on human suffering that was tragically doomed.**...More than anyone, it was Gogol who fixed the city’s image as an alienating place...Gogol’s Petersburg is a city of illusions and deceit..**“Gogol’s Petersburg is a ghostly image of the real city, a nightmare vision of a world deprived of grace, where only human greed and vanity can thrive.**...**Dostoevsky said that the whole of Russian literature ‘came out from underneath Gogol’s “Overcoat”**...**in later works, such as Crime and Punishment, he adds an important psychological dimension to the “capital’s topography. Dostoevsky creates his unreal city through the diseased mental world of his characters, so that it becomes ‘fantastically real'. In the minds of dreamers like Raskolnikov, fantasy becomes reality, and life becomes a game in which any action, even murder, can be justified. Here is a place where human feelings are perverted and destroyed by human isolation and rationality.**."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**Moscow, by contrast, was a place of down-to-earth pursuits.** With the rise of Petersburg in the eighteenth century, Moscow became the centre of the ‘good life’ for the nobility. Pushkin said that it attracted ‘rascals and eccentrics’ - independent noblemen who ‘shunned the court and lived without a care, devoting all their passions to harmless scandal-mongering and hospitality’....Petersburgers despised Moscow for its sinful idleness. ‘Moscow is an abyss of hedonistic pleasure’, wrote Turgenev. ‘All its people do is eat, drink, sleep, go to parties and play cards - and all at the expense of the suffering of their serfs.’ **Yet no one could deny its Russian character. ‘Moscow may be wild and dissolute’, wrote Vigel, ‘but there is no point in trying to change it. For there is a part of Moscow in us all, and no Russian can expunge Moscow.'**.*
    - Chapter 3 - *"Moscow was the food capital of Russia. No other city could boast such a range of restaurants...Cooks were regarded by their masters as the equals of artists, and no expense was spared to have them trained abroad...There were gentry households where the whole day was (in Pushkin’s words) ‘a chain of meals’...Sumptuous eating of this sort was a relatively new phenomenon. The food of seventeenth-century Muscovy had been plain and simple...It was not until the eighteenth century that more interesting foods and culinary techniques were imported from abroad...Not just nourishment, foodstuffs had an iconic part to play in Russian popular culture. **Bread, for example, had a religious and symbolic importance that went far beyond its role in daily life; its significance in Russian culture was far greater than it was in the other Christian cultures of the West. The word for bread (Хлеб) was used in Russian for ‘wealth’, ‘health’ and ‘hospitality'.**."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"It was the test of a ‘true Russian’ to be able to drink vodka by the bucketful. Since the sixteenth century, when the art of distillation spread to Russia from the West, the custom had been to indulge in mammoth drinking bouts on festive occasions and holidays. Drinking was a social thing - it was never done alone - and it was bound up with communal celebrations. This meant that, contrary to the mythic image, the overall consumption of vodka was not that great (in the year there were 200 fasting days when drinking was prohibited). But when the Russian drank, he drank an awful lot....Deaths from drinking claimed a thousand people every year in Russia between 1841 and 1859. Yet it would be wrong to conclude from this that the Russian drinking problem was an endemic or an ancient one. In fact, it was only in the modern period - starting in the late eighteenth century - that Russian levels of alcohol consumption became a threat to national life; and even then the problem was essentially fabricated by the gentry and the state. The traditional drinking pattern had been set in a context where alcohol was scarce and rare commodity that could only be afforded on a holiday. But in the latter part of the eighteenth century the gentry distillers who were licensed by the state to manufacture vodka increased their production many times. With the 1775 reform of local government, which transferred the control of the police to gentry magistrates, there was little state control of the booming retail business, legal or illegal, which made vodka traders very rich. Suddenly, there were vodka shops in every town, taverns all over the place, and, other than religious proscription, no more limitations on drinking. The government was conscious of the social costs of increased drunkenness, and the Church was constantly raising the issue, campaigning noisily against the drinking shops. The problem was to modify a drinking pattern that had been formed over many centuries - the habit of overdrinking whenever the Russians drank - or else to reduce the supply of drink. But since the state derived at least a quarter of its its total revenues from vodka sales, and the aristocracy had vested interests in the trade, there was little pressure for reform. It was not until the First World War that the state came down on the side of sobriety. But the ban on vodka which it introduced only made the drinking problem worse (for the Russians turned to paraffin and illegal moonshines that were far more dangerous), while the loss of tax revenues from vodka sales was a major contribution to the downfall of the regime in 1917."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**'The difference between Moscow and St Petersburg is this. In Moscow, if you have not seen a friend for a few days, you think there’s something wrong and send out someone to check that he’s not dead. But in Peter, you may not be seen for a year or two and no one will miss you.’** Muscovites have always taken comfort from the image of their city as a warm and friendly ‘home’. Compared with the cold and formal Petersburg, Moscow prided itself on its relaxed ‘Russian’ customs and its hospitality...The Russian custom of opening one’s doors at lunch and dinner time for anyone of rank was an important part of this culture of hospitality."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"In contrast to the rigid European classicism of the St Petersburg Academy, the atmosphere in Moscow was rather more relaxed and open to the exploration of Russian themes and styles. Artists flocked to Moscow to study its icons, its lubok painting and Palekh lacquer work...Icon painters flourished in the towns around Moscow, but there were none in Petersburg...In Gartman’s world of architectural design, the mid-century boom in the neo-Russian style was made possible by the abolition of an eighteenth-century law stipulating that buildings in the centre of Moscow should be made from stone with facades in approved European styles. The repeal of this law, in 1858, opened the way for a spate of wooden buildings in the Russian peasant style. More than ever, Moscow took on the appearance of a ‘big village’...Orthodoxy was ‘the primary cultural element of Russia’s nationhood’...Musorgsky fell in love with Moscow’s ‘Russianness’. He had spent nearly all his life in Petersburg. But as an artist he was drawn to the ‘realm of fairy tales’ which he discovered in the ancient capital...It allowed Musorgsky, who had always been perceived as something of an outcast in St Petersburg, to experiment with music from the Russian soil."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**Stasov wanted Russian art to liberate itself from Europe’s hold. By copying the West, the Russians could be at best second-rate; but by borrowing from their own native traditions they might create a truly national art that matched Europe’s with its high artistic standards and originality...In his view, art should be ‘national’ in the sense that it portrayed the people’s daily lives, was meaningful to them, and taught them how to live.**."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**Russian church bells have a special musicality which is unlike the sound of any other bells. The Russian technique of bell-chiming is for the ringers to strike the different bells directly with hammers, or by using short cords attached to the clappers. This encourages a form of counterpoint - albeit with the dissonances which result from the resounding echoes of the bells.** The Western technique of ringing bells by swinging them with long ropes from the ground makes such synchronization all but impossible to achieve."*

    - Chapter 3 - *"Alongside their interest in its ‘Russian style’, writers, artists and composers developed an obsession with Moscow’s history....**It is no coincidence that nearly all these works concerned the final years of Ivan the Terrible and the so-called ‘Time of Troubles’ between the reign of Boris Godunov and the foundation of the Romanov dynasty. History was regarded as a battlefield for competing views of Russia and its destiny, and these fifty years were seen as a crucial period in Russia’s past. They were a time when everything was up for grabs and the nation was confronted by fundamental questions of identity. Was it to be governed by elected rulers or by Tsars? Was it to be part of Europe or remain outside of it? The same questions were being asked by thinking Russians in the nineteenth century.**...Boris Godunov was a vital figure in this national debate. The histories, plays and operas that were written about him were also a discourse on Russia’s destiny. The Godunov we know from Pushkin and Musorgsky appeared first in Karamzin’s History. Karamzin portrayed Godunov as a tragic figure, a progressive ruler who was haunted by the past, a man of immense power and yet human frailty who was undone by the gap between political necessity and his own conscience....**the Moscow boyars voted for Boris to become Tsar - the first elected Tsar in Russian history.**"*
    - Chapter 3 - *"The early years of the Godunov reign were prosperous and peaceful. In many ways Boris was an enlightened monarch - a man ahead of his own time...But in 1601-3 things went badly wrong. A series of harvest failures led to the starvation of about one-quarter of the peasantry in Muscovy, and since the crisis was made worse by the new laws of serfdom which took away the peasants’ rights of movement, the rural protests were aimed against the Tsar...Then, in the middle of this political crisis, a young pretender to the Russian throne appeared with an army from Poland..The pretender was Grigory Otrepev, a runaway monk who had been at one time in the service of the Romanovs, and he was probably approached by them before his escapade. He claimed to be the Tsarevich Dmitry, Ivan’s youngest son...‘False Dmitry’."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**Karamzin’s History was dedicated to the Emperor Alexander - the reigning Tsar from the House of Romanov - and its vision was overtly monarchist. The moral lesson which he drew from the Godunov story - that elected rulers are never any good - was carefully attuned to the politics of Alexander’s reign**...Pushkin’s Boris Godunov was very closely based on Karamzin’s History. The conception of the play is firmly royalist - the people play no active part in their own history...**“Kostomarov viewed the common people as the fundamental force of history.**....**It was Moscow that had infected him with the history bug. He loved its ‘smell of antiquity’ which transported him ‘into another world’. For Musorgsky, Moscow was a symbol of the Russian land - it represented a huge weight of inertia in the customs and beliefs of old Russia.**...**The Streltsy revolt and its aftermath marked a crossroads in Russian history, a period when the new dynamic Petrine state clashed with the forces of tradition.**."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"And he held to the conviction that the Old Believers were the last ‘authentic Russians’, whose way of life had not yet been disturbed by European ways...These views were shared by writers such as Dostoevsky - at that time a member of the ‘native soil’ movement (pocbvennichestvo), a sort of synthesis between the Westernizers and the Slavophiles which was immensely influential among writers and critics in the early 1860s....**Surikov idealized Moscow as a ‘legendary realm of the authentic Russian way of life’.**...They overlooked their traditional superstition that to paint a person was a sin, allowing Surikov to sketch them."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**The 1880s was a time of renewed political repression following the assassination of Alexander II by revolutionary terrorists in March 1881. The new Tsar, Alexander III, passed a series of decrees rolling back their reforms: new controls were imposed on local government; censorship was tightened; the personal rule of the Tsar was reasserted through his direct agents in the provinces; and a modern police state began to take shape.**."*

Three-quarters of its population had been born elsewhere. The railways held the key to Moscow’s growth...Moscow, then, emerged as the metropolis of capitalist Russia - a position it still occupies today...The railway was a symbol of modernity: it brought in a new life and destroyed the old."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**All over Europe it was commonplace for the nineteenth-century cultural elites to hold trade and commerce in contempt, and such attitudes were equally pronounced in the intelligentsia. But nowhere else did they have such an effect as in Russia, where they poisoned the relations of the middle classes with the cultural elites and thereby closed off the possibility of Russia going down the capitalist-bourgeois path - until it was too late.** Even as late as the 1890s merchants were excluded from the social circles of Moscow’s aristocracy...As a social group that lay somewhere between the peasantry and the educated classes, the merchants, **they believed, were uniquely qualified to lead the nation in a way that reconciled its Muscovite and Petrine elements.**...Despite the old mistrust between the classes, many of these magnates felt a strong desire for acceptance by the leaders of society. They did not want to join the aristocracy. **But they did want to belong to the cultural elite, and they knew that their acceptance depended on their public service and philanthropy - above all, on their support for the arts. This condition was particularly important in Russia, where the cultural influence of the intelligentsia was far stronger than it was in the West. Whereas in America and many parts of Europe, money was enough to become accepted in society, even if the old snobbish attitudes prevailed, Russia never shared the bourgeois cult of money, and its cultural elites were defined by a service ethic that placed a burden on the rich to use their wealth for the people’s benefit.**."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"This was the high point of the cult of Muscovy. It was engineered by the last Tsar in a desperate effort to invest the monarchy with a mythical historical legitimacy at a time when its right to rule was being challenged by the institutions of democracy. The Romanovs were retreating to the past, hoping it would save them from the future. Nicholas, in particular, idealized the Tsardom of Alexei in the seventeenth century. He saw in it a golden age of paternal rule, when the Tsar had ruled in a mystical union with the Orthodox people, undisturbed by the complications of a modern state. He loathed St Petersburg, with its secular ideas and bureaucracy, its Western culture and intelligentsia, so alien to the ‘simple Russian folk’, and he tried to Muscovitize it by adding onion domes and kokoshnik pediments to the classical facades of its buildings"*

    - Chapter 3 - *"The retreat to Russian wonderland was a general trend in the final decades of the nineteenth century, when the increased censorship of Alexander III’s reign and the early years of Nicholas II’s made it hard for the realist school to use art for social or political commentary...‘When I came to Moscow, I felt I had come home’, he wrote to Stasov. ‘The first time I saw the Kremlin and St Basil’s, tears welled in my eyes: so forceful was the feeling that they are a part of me.'...Vasnetsov brought the vibrant primary colours of the folk tradition to the stage for Rimsky’s Snow Maiden, the big success of the first season. The bulky bulbous form of Tsar Berendei’s palace, with its lavishly ornate folk-style decorations and fantastic columns shaped and painted like Russian Easter eggs, was inspired by the wooden palace of Kolomenskoe just outside Moscow. The whole scene conjured up a magic Russian realm, and it left the public, which had never seen such folk art on the stage before, enraptured and amazed....Mamontov was accused of appropriating funds from his railway empire to support the Opera."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"As a student Stanislavsky took part in the Mamontov amateur productions. These convinced him that, while huge efforts had been put into the music, the costumes and the sets, very little had been done about the acting, which remained extremely amateurish, not just in the operas but in the theatre, too. He trained himself as an actor by standing for hours before a mirror every day and developing his gestures over several years to make them appear more natural. His famous ‘method’ (from which ‘method acting’ was to come) boiled down to a sort of naturalism. It was acting without ‘acting’ - which fitted in so well with the modern dialogue (where the pauses are as important as the words) and the everyday realities of Chekhov’s plays.107 Later his method was made more systematic through a series of techniques to help the actor convey the inner thoughts and emotions of a part. They were all about recalling moments of intense experience in the actor’s own life, supposedly to help him produce the emotion on demand."*

It was a critique of the landed gentry, which had never really known the meaning of hard work and for this reason was destined for decline."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**Moscow was the centre of the avant-garde; Petersburg was ‘a city of artistic gossiping, academic professors and Friday watercolour classes...But Moscow really was the place to be in 1900, when the Russian avant-garde first burst on to the scene. Along with Paris, Berlin and Milan, it became a major centre in the world of art, and its extraordinary collection of avant-garde artists were as much influenced by trends in Europe as they were by Moscow’s heritage. Its progressive politics, its relaxed atmosphere, its noisy modern ways and new technologies - there was so much in Moscow’s cultural milieu to inspire artists in experimental forms.**...Moscow’s younger generation of merchant patrons embraced and collected modern art. They saw it as an ally of their own campaign to transform the old Russia along modern lines...**'because with only Petersburg, without Moscow, it would have been impossible to breathe freely, to acquire the true feeling for Russia.'**.*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**After 1917 Moscow superseded Petersburg. It became the Soviet capital, the cultural centre of the state, a city of modernity and a model of the new industrial society the Bolsheviks wanted to build...It was a city of unprecedented freedom and experimentation in life as in art, and the avant-garde believed, if only for a few years in the 1920s, that they saw their ideal city taking shape in it...From the old idea of Moscow as the Third Rome to the Soviet one of it as leader of the Third International, it was but a short step in the city’s mission to save humanity.**."*
    - Chapter 3 - *"**And yet throughout the twentieth century Moscow was still ‘home’. It was still the mother city it had always been, and, when Hitler attacked it in the autumn of 1941, its people fought to defend it. There was no question of abandoning the city, as Kutuzov had abandoned it to Napoleon in 1812. A quarter of a million Muscovites dug last-ditch defences, carted food to the soldiers at the front and cared for the injured in their homes. With one last desperate effort the Germans were pushed back from the city’s gates - a spot still marked today by a giant iron cross on the road from Moscow to the Sheremetevo airport. It was not the Soviet capital but Mother Moscow which was saved.**."*
    - Chapter 4 "The Peasant Marriage" - *"In the summer of 1874 thousands of students left their lecture halls in Moscow and St Petersburg and travelled incognito to the countryside to start out on a new life with the Russian peasantry. Renouncing their homes and families, they were **‘going to the people’** in the hopeful expectation of finding a new nation in the brotherhood of man...By merging with the people and sharing in the burdens of their lives, these young revolutionaries hoped to win their trust and make them understand the full horror of their social condition."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"Yet this was no ordinary political movement. **The ‘going to the people’ was a form of pilgrimage**, and the type of person who became involved in it was similar to those who went in search of truth to a monastery. **These young missionaries were riddled with the guilt of privilege.** Many of them felt a personal guilt towards that class of serfs - the nannies and the servants - who had helped to bring them up in their families’ aristocratic mansions. They sought to free themselves from their parents’ sinful world, whose riches had been purchased by the people’s sweat and blood, and set out for the village in a spirit of repentance to establish a ‘New Russia’ in which the noble and the peasant would be reunited in the nation’s spiritual rebirth. **By dedicating themselves to the people’s cause - to the liberation of the peasantry from poverty and ignorance and from the oppression of the gentry and the state - the students hoped to redeem their own sin: that of being born into privilege.**."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"**What had given rise to these idealistic hopes was the emancipation of the serfs. Writers such as Dostoevsky compared the Decree of 1861 to the conversion of Russia to Christianity in the tenth century.**...**'every Russian is a Russian first of all, and only after that does he belong to a class’. The educated classes were called upon to recognize their ‘Russianness’ and to turn towards the peasants as a cultural mission - educating them as citizens and reuniting Russia on the basis of a national literature and art.**...Brought up as they were in the European world of the noble palace and the university, they were on a journey to an unknown land and a new and moral life based on ‘Russian principles’. They saw the emancipation as an exorcism of Russia’s sinful past - and out of that a new nation would be born....**Nikolai Chernyshevsky in his seminal novel What Is to Be Done (1862). Here was a novel that offered its readers a blueprint of the new society. It became a bible for the revolutionaries, including the young Lenin, who said that his whole life had been transformed by it.**."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"'The peasants have completely overwhelmed us in our literature’, wrote Turgenev ‘Yet I am beginning to suspect that we still don’t really understand them or anything about their lives.’ But they applied equally to the intelligentsia’s obsession with the **‘peasant question’, which dominated Russian culture after 1861. With the emancipation of the serfs, the rest of society was forced to recognize the peasant as a fellow citizen.** Suddenly the old accursed questions about Russia’s destiny became bound up with **the peasant’s true identity. Was he good or bad? Could he be civilized? What could he do for Russia? And where did he come from? No one knew the answers.**...**Russia is contained in the rural depths Where eternal silence reigns**....the peasant had become ‘the hero of our time’. The literary image of the Russian peasant in the early nineteenth century was by and large a sentimental one: he was a stock character with human feelings rather than a thinking individual. **Everything changed in 1852, with the publication of Turgenev’s masterpiece, Sketches from a Hunter’s Album. Here, for the first time in Russian literature, readers were confronted with the image of the peasant as a rational human being**... Turgenev portrayed the peasant as a person capable of both practical administration and lofty dreams. He felt a profound sympathy for the Russian serf...**Sketches from a Hunter’s Album played a crucial role in changing public attitudes towards the serfs and the question of reform. Turgenev later said that the proudest moment in his life came shortly after 1861, when two peasants approached him on a train from Orel to Moscow and bowed down to the ground in the Russian manner to ‘thank him in the name of the whole people’.**."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"Dostoevsky: **'The question of the people and our view of them… is our most important question, a question on which our whole future rests… But the people are still a theory for us and they still stand before us as a riddle. We, the lovers of the people, regard them as part of a theory, and it seems not one of us loves them as they really are but only as each of us imagines them to be. And should the Russian people turn out not as we imagined them, then we, despite our love of them, would at once renounce them without regret'**.."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"Each theory ascribed certain virtues to the peasant which it then took as the essence of the national character. For the Populists, the peasant was a natural socialist, the embodiment of the collective spirit that distinguished Russia from the bourgeois West. Democrats like Herzen saw the peasant as a champion of liberty - his wildness embodying the spirit of the Russia that was free. The Slavophiles regarded him as a Russian patriot, suffering and patient, a humble follower of truth and justice, like the folk hero Ilia Muromets. They argued that the peasant commune was a living proof that Russia need not look beyond its national borders for guiding moral principles...**This convergence on the peasant issue was indicative of a broader national consensus or ideology which emerged in Russia at this time. The old arguments between the Westernizers and the Slavophiles gradually died down as each side came to recognize the need for Russia to find a proper balance between Western learning and native principles...In short, by the 1860s there was a common view that Russia should evolve along a European path of liberal reform, yet not break too sharply from its unique historical traditions. It was a case of keeping Peter and the peasant, too.** This was the position of the ‘native soil’ movement to which Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail belonged in the 1860s...**Populism was the cultural product of this synthesis and, as such, it became something of a national creed. The romantic interest in folk culture which swept through Europe in the nineteenth century was nowhere felt more keenly than among the Russian intelligentsia.**...The intelligentsia was defined by its mission of service to the people, just as the noble class was defined by its service to the state; and the intelligentsia lived by the view, which many of its members came to regret, that ‘the good of the people’ was the highest interest, to which all other principles, such as law or Christian precepts, were subordinate."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"The liberal spirit of reform which had brought about the emancipation continued to inform the government’s approach towards the peasantry in the 1860s and 1870s. With the peasant’s liberation from the gentry’s jurisdiction there was a recognition that he had become the state’s responsibility: he had become a citizen...After 1861 the government set up a whole range of institutions to improve the welfare of its peasant citizens and integrate them into national life..zemstvos..Many of the students who had taken part in the ‘going to the people’ ended up as zemstvo employees."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"The socialist ideas of the Populists were strange and foreign to the peasantry, or at least they could not understand them in the terms in which they were explained to them...Populists returned from their defeat in deep despair. They had invested so much of their own personalities in their idealized conception of the peasantry, they had hung so much of their personal salvation on the ‘people’s cause’, that to see them both collapse was a catastrophic blow to their identity."*

    - [Why Tolstoy believed Russia didn't need Western freedoms](https://www.rbth.com/arts/335616-tolstoy-russia-european-freedoms) *"In that first period Tolstoy had proposed to reduce the dues of the serfs on his estate - but the serfs mistrusted his intentions and had turned his offer down. Tolstoy was annoyed - he had underestimated the gap between nobleman and serf...But by the time of his return in 1856, there was a new spirit of reform in the air. The Tsar had told the gentry to prepare for the liberation of their serfs. With new determination Tolstoy threw himself into the task of living with the peasants in a ‘life of truth’. He was disgusted with his former life - the gambling, the whoring, the excessive feasting and drinking, the embarrassment of riches, and the lack of any real work or purpose in his life. Like the Populists with their ‘going to the people’, he vowed to live a new life, a life of moral truth that was based on peasant labour and the brotherhood of man....On his own estate Tolstoy gave the peasants a sizeable proportion of his land - nowhere else in Russia was the manifesto fulfilled in a spirit of such generosity. Tolstoy almost yearned, it seemed, to give away his wealth. He dreamed of abandoning his privileged existence and living like a peasant on the land. For a while he even tried...**Tolstoy’s life was full of contradictions and he never could decide if he should become a peasant or remain a nobleman.** On the one hand he embraced the elite culture of the aristocracy. War and Peace is a novel that rejoices in that world...On the other hand, his whole life was a struggle to renounce that elite world of shameful privilege and live ‘by the sweat of his own brow’. The quest for a simple life of toil was a constant theme in Tolstoy’s works...Yet even after his spiritual crisis Tolstoy was ambivalent: he idealized the peasants and loved to be with them, but for many years he could not bring himself to break from the conventions of society and become one himself. In many ways he only played at being a ‘peasant’...**Tolstoy was aware of the ambiguity, and for years he agonized. As a writer, and a Russian one at that, he felt the artist’s responsibility to provide leadership and enlightenment for the people...Yet at the same time he was moving to the view that the peasants were the teachers of society and that neither he nor any other scion of the world’s immoral civilizations had anything to give.**."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"Tolstoy saw the Kitty-Levin marriage as an ideal Christian love: each lives for the other and, through that love, they both live in God. Tolstoy’s own life was a search for just this communion, this sense of belonging. The theme runs right through his literary work....But here too he failed to find true union. His own selfishness was always in the way."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"In 1897 Russian society was engulfed in a storm of debate over a short tale. Chekhov’s ‘Peasants'...**The myth of the good peasant had been punctured by the tale.** The peasant was now just a human being, brutalized and coarsened by his poverty, not the bearer of special moral lessons for society. The Populists denounced Chekhov for failing to reflect the spiritual ideals of peasant life. Tolstoy called the story ‘a sin before the people and said that Chekhov had not looked into the peasant’s soul. Slavophiles attacked it as a slander against Russia. But the Marxists, whose opinions were beginning to be heard, praised the story for revealing the way the rise of the capitalist town had caused the decline of the village...**It may seem odd that a work of literature should cause such huge shock waves throughout society. But Russia’s identity was built upon the myth which Chekhov had destroyed. The Populist ideal of the peasantry had become so fundamental to the nation’s conception of itself that to question this ideal was to throw the whole of Russia into agonizing doubt.** The impact of the story was all the more disturbing for the simple factual style in which it was composed...Chekhov’s story was the fruit of its author’s first-hand knowledge of the peasantry...Over the years he had come to know the peasants through his work as a doctor."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"**Beneath all the din surrounding Chekhov’s story there was a profound question about Russia’s future as a peasant land. The old rural Russia was being swept aside by the advance of the towns, and the nation was divided over it. For the Slavophiles and the Populists, who saw Russia’s unique virtues in the old peasant culture and community, the growing subjugation of the village to the town was a national catastrophe. But for Westernists, the liberals and the Marxists, who embraced the city as a modernizing force, the peasantry was backward and bound to die away.** Even the government was forced to reassess its peasant policy as the influence of the urban market began to change the countryside. The peasant commune was no longer feeding the growing population of the countryside, let alone providing a marketable surplus for the state to tax; and as the agrarian crisis deepened, it became the organizing kernel of the peasant revolution."*

    - Chapter 4 - *"This dark mood was captured in what must surely be the bleakest portrait of rural life in any literature: Ivan Bunin’s novella The Village (1910). Bunin had experience of peasant life. Unlike Turgenev or Tolstoy, who were scions of the elite aristocracy, Bunin belonged to the minor provincial gentry, who had always lived in close proximity to the peasants and whose lives resembled theirs in many ways. Bunin saw the peasant as the ‘national type’ and his stories about them were intended to be judgements on the Russian people and their history. He had never had any illusions about the spiritual or noble qualities of the peasants...Bunin’s early stories dealt with the harsh realities of country life in the 1890s - a decade of famine and flight from the land. They are full of images of destruction and decay: abandoned villages, factories belching blood red smoke, the peasants old or sick...The Village gave a huge jolt to society. **More perhaps than any other work, it made the Russians think about the hopeless destiny of their peasant land.**."*

In 1914 he had told the French writer Romain Rolland that he was ‘counting on a revolution after the war to bring down the dynasty and establish a Slavic United States’....It was as if he had found a new homeland in this common language with the Russian peasantry. Through music he could recover the Russia he had lost. **This was the idea behind The Peasant Wedding - an attempt, in his own words, to re-create in art an essential ur-Russia, the ancient peasant Russia that had been concealed by the thin veneer of European civilization since the eighteenth century.** It was the holy Russia of the Orthodox, a Russia stripped of its parasitic vegetation; its bureaucracy from Germany, a certain strain of English liberalism much in fashion with the aristocracy; its scientism (alas!), its ‘intellectuals’ and their inane and bookish faith in progress; it is the Russia of before Peter the Great and before Europeanism… a peasant, but above all Christian, Russia, and truly the only Christian land in Europe, the one which laughs and cries (laughs and cries both at once without always really knowing which is which) in The Peasant Wedding, the one we saw awaken to herself in confusion and magnificently full of impurities in The Rite of Spring."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"Stravinsky had hit upon a form of music that expressed the vital energy and spirit of the people - a truly national music in the Stasovian sense. Stravinsky had drafted the first part of The Peasant Wedding by the end of 1914. When he played it to Diaghilev, the impresario broke down in tears and said it was **‘the most beautiful and the most purely Russian creation of our Ballet’**...**The Peasant Wedding was a work of musical ethnography. In later years Stravinsky tried to deny this. Immersed in the cosmopolitan culture of interwar Paris, and driven by his hatred of the Soviet regime, he made a public show of distancing himself from his Russian heritage. But he was not convincing. The ballet was precisely what Stravinsky claimed that it was not: a direct expression of the music and the culture of the peasantry.** Based on a close reading of the folklore sources, and drawing all its music from the peasants’ wedding songs, the ballet’s whole conception was to re-create the peasant wedding ritual as a work of art on stage."*
    - Chapter 4 - *"It was a commonplace in the Eurasian circles in which Stravinsky moved in Paris that **the greatest strength of the Russian people, and the thing that set them apart from the people of the West, was their voluntary surrender of the individual will to collective rituals and forms of life.** This sublimation of the individual was precisely what had attracted Stravinsky to the subject of the ballet in the first place -it was a perfect vehicle for the sort of peasant music he had been composing since The Rite of Spring. **In The Peasant Wedding there was no room for emotion in the singing parts. The voices were supposed to merge as one, as they did in church chants and peasant singing, to create a sound Stravinsky once described as ‘perfectly homogeneous, perfectly impersonal, and perfectly mechanical’.**...**The choreography was equally impersonal - the corps de ballet moving all as one, like some vast machine made of human beings, and carrying the whole of the storyline. ‘There were no leading parts, each member would blend through the movement into the whole..and..the action of the separate characters would be expressed, not by each one individually, but rather by the action of the whole ensemble.’ It was the perfect ideal of the Russian peasantry.**"*

All the greatest writers of the nineteenth century - Gogol, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy among them - came here in their search for the ‘Russian soul’."*

    - Chapter 5 - *"Hesychasm has its roots in the Orthodox conception of divine grace. In contrast to the Western view that grace is conferred on the virtuous or on those whom God has so ordained, **the Orthodox religion regards grace as a natural state, implied in the act of creation itself, and therefore potentially available to any human being merely by virtue of having been created by the Lord.** In this view the way the believer approaches God is through the consciousness of his own spiritual personality and by studying the example of Christ in order to cope better with the dangers that await him on his journey through life."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"It was only natural that the nineteenth-century **search for a true Russian faith should look back to the mysticism of medieval monks. Here was a form of religious consciousness that seemed to touch a chord in the Russian people, a form of consciousness that was somehow more essential and emotionally charged than the formalistic religion of the official Church.** Here, moreover, was a faith in sympathy with the Romantic sensibility....They saw the monastery as a religious version of their own striving for community - a sacred microcosm of their ideal Russia - and on that basis **they defined the Church as a spiritual union of the Orthodox, the true community of Christian love that was only to be found in the Russian Church.** This was a Slavophile mythology, of course, but **there was a core of mysticism in the Russian Church. Unlike the Western Churches, whose theology is based on a reasoned understanding of divinity, the Russian Church believes that God cannot be grasped by the human mind.**...The only way to approach the Russian God is through the spiritual transcendence of this world."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"This emphasis on the mystical experience of the Divinity was associated with two important features of the Russian Church. One was the creed of resignation and withdrawal from life. **The Russian monasteries were totally devoted to the contemplative life and, unlike their counterparts in western Europe, they played no active part in public life or scholarship. Orthodoxy preached humility** and, more than any other Church, it made a cult of passive suffering...The second consequence of this mystical approach was **the burden that it placed on ritual and art, on the emotional experience of the liturgy, as a spiritual entry to the divine realm. The beauty of the church - the most striking outward feature of the Orthodox religion** - was its fundamental argument as well."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"According to a story in the Primary Chronicle, the first recorded history of Kievan Rus’, compiled by monks in the eleventh century, **the Russians were converted to Byzantine Christianity by the appearance of the churches in Constantinople.** Vladimir, the pagan prince of Kievan Rus’ in the tenth century, sent his emissaries to visit various countries in search of the True Faith. They went first to the Muslim Bulgars of the Volga, but found no joy or virtue in their religion. They went to Rome and Germany, but thought their churches plain. But in Constantinople, the emissaries reported, **‘we knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth, for surely there is no such splendour or beauty anywhere on earth'**."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**The Russian Church is contained entirely in its liturgy, and to understand it there is no point reading books: one has to go and see the Church at prayer. The Russian Orthodox service is an emotional experience. The entire spirit of the Russian people, and much of their best art and music, has been poured into the Church, and at times of national crisis, under the Mongols or the Communists, they have always turned to it for support and hope. The liturgy has never become the preserve of scholars or the clergy, as happened in the medieval West. This is a people’s liturgy. There are no pews, no social hierarchies, in a Russian church."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**You are struck by the same same kind of extraordinary sense of motion in the Easter service itself.** The heavenly gates stand wide open in all the side-altars, dense clouds of smoky incense hang in the air around the candelabra; wherever you look there are lights, brightness and candles spluttering everywhere. There are no readings planned; the energetic, joyful singing does not stop until the end.."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**Anyone who goes to a Russian church service is bound to be impressed by the beauty of its chants and choral song. The entire liturgy is sung.**...Orthodoxy’s ban on instrumental music encouraged a remarkable development of colour and variety in vocal writing for the Church. The polyphonic harmonies of folk song were assimilated to the znamenny plainchants - so called because they were written down by special signs (znameni) instead of Western notes - **which gave them their distinctive Russian sound and feel.**....which over several hours (the Orthodox service can be interminably long) could have the effect of inducing a trance-like state of religious ecstasy...“Churches famous for their deacons and their choirs drew huge congregations - **Russians being drawn to the spiritual impact of liturgical music, above all**. Part of this, however, may have been explained by the fact that the Church had a monopoly on the composition of sacred music - Tchaikovsky was the first to challenge it when he wrote the Liturgy of St John Chrysostom in 1878 - so that **it was not until the final decades of the nineteenth century that the public could hear sacred music in a concert hall.**"*
    - Chapter 5 - *"Rachmaninov’s Vespers, or All Night Vigil (1915), was intended to be used as a part of the liturgy. The summation of Rachmaninov’s religious faith, it was based on a detailed study of the ancient chants and in this sense it can stand not simply as a work of sacred art but also as the synthesis of an entire culture of religious life."*

    - Chapter 5 - *"**Russians pray with their eyes open - their gaze fixed on an icon. For contemplating the icon is itself perceived as a form of prayer. The icon is a gateway to the holy sphere, not a decoration or instruction for the poor, as sacred images became in western Europe from medieval times. In contrast to the Catholics, the Orthodox confess, not to a priest, but to the icon of Christ with a priest in attendance as a spiritual guide.** The icon is the focal point of the believer’s religious emotion -it links him to the saints and the Holy Trinity - and for this reason **it is widely seen by Russians as a sacred object in itself.** Even an ‘outsider’ like Kireevsky, who had been a convert to the Roman Church, felt himself attracted to the icon’s ‘marvellous power’. As he told Herzen: 'I once stood at a shrine and gazed at a wonder-working icon of the Mother of God, thinking of the childlike faith of the people praying before it; some women and infirm old men knelt, crossing themselves and bowing down to the earth. With ardent hope I gazed at the holy features, and little by little the secret of their marvellous power began to grow clear to me. **Yes, this was not just a painted board - for centuries it had absorbed these passions and these hopes, the prayers of the afflicted and unhappy; it was filled with the energy of all these prayers. It had become a living organism, a meeting place between the Lord and men**'..."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**Icons came to Russia from Byzantium in the tenth century**, and for the first two hundred years or so they were dominated by the Greek style. **But the Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century cut off Russia from Byzantium; and the monasteries, which were largely left alone and even flourished at this time, began to develop their own style. The Russian icon came to be distinguished by qualities that guided the worshipper at prayer: a simple harmony of line and colour and a captivating use of ‘inverse perspective’ (where lines seem to converge on a point in front of the picture) to draw the viewer into the picture space and to symbolize the fact, in the words of Russia’s greatest icon scholar Leonid Ouspensky, that ‘the action taking place before our eyes is outside the laws of earthly existence'**."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"That style reached its supreme heights in Andrei Rublev’s icons of the early fifteenth century - an era coinciding with Russia’s triumph over Tatar rule, so that **this flowering of sacred art became a cherished part of national identity. Rublev’s icons came to represent the nation’s spiritual unity. What defined the Russians - at this crucial moment when they were without a state - was their Christianity.** Readers may recall the last, symbolic scene of Andrei Tarkovsky’s film about the icon painter, Andrei Rublev (1966), when a group of craftsmen cast a giant bell for the ransacked church of Vladimir. It is an unforgettable image - **a symbol of the way in which the Russians have endured through their spiritual strength and creativity.** Not surprising, then, that the film was suppressed in the Brezhnev years."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**It is hard to overstress the importance of the fact that Russia received its Christianity from Byzantium and not from the West.** It was in the spirit of the Byzantine tradition that the Russian Empire came to see itself as a theocracy, **a truly Christian realm where Church and state were united.** The god-like status of the Tsar was a legacy of this tradition. After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks, the Russian Church proclaimed Moscow to be the Third Rome - the direct heir to Byzantium and the last remaining seat of the Orthodox religion, with a messianic role to save the Christian world....**'Holy Russia' thus emerged as the providential land of salvation - a messianic consciousness that became reinforced by its isolation from the West."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**With Byzantium’s decline, Russia was cut off from the mainstream of Christian civilization and, by the end of the fifteenth century, it was the only major kingdom still espousing Eastern Christianity. As a consequence, the Russian Church grew introspective and withdrawn, more intolerant of other faiths, and more protective of its national rituals.** It became a state and national Church. Culturally the roots of this went deep into the history of Byzantium itself. Unlike the Western Church, Byzantium had no papacy to give it supranational cohesion...So from the start the Orthodox community was inclined to break down into independent Churches along national lines (Greek, Russian, Serbian, etc.) - with the result that religion reinforced, and often became synonymous with, national identity. **To say ‘Russian’ was to say ‘Orthodox’.**...**it may be difficult to understand how rituals can define a national group. But rituals are essential to the Orthodox religion - indeed, the very meaning of the concept ‘Orthodox’ is rooted in the idea of the ‘correct rituals’**. This explains why Orthodoxy is so fundamentally conservative - for purity of ritual is a matter of the utmost importance to the Church - and why indeed its dissenting movements have generally opposed any innovations in the liturgy, the Old Believers being the most obvious case in point."*

The annual celebration of a person’s saint’s day was even more important than that of their birth-day.** Every major event in a Russian’s life - entry into school and university, joining the army or civil service, purchasing an estate or house, marriage and death - received some form of blessing from a priest. **Russia had more religious holidays than any other Christian country. But no other Church was so hard on the stomach.** There were five weeks of fasting during May and June, two weeks in August, six weeks leading up to Christmas Eve, and seven weeks during Lent. The Lenten fast, which was the one fast kept by all classes of society, began after **Shrovetide, the most colourful of the Russian holidays**, when everybody gorged themselves on pancakes and went for sleigh rides or tobogganing.”*

But the aspect of the city would change dramatically on the first day of Lent. ‘The endless ringing of bells called everyone to prayer’, recalled Mikhail Zernov. ‘Forbidden food was banished from all houses and a mushroom market started up on the banks of the Moscow river, where one could buy everything one needed to survive the fast - mushrooms, pickled cabbage, gherkins, frozen apples and rowanberries, all kinds of bread made with Lenten butter, and a special type of sugar with the blessing of the Church.’11During Lent there were daily services. With every passing day the religious tension mounted, until its release in Easter week, recalled Zernov. On the eve of Easter Moscow broke out of its ordered services and a screaming, raving market opened on Red Square."*

    - Chapter 5 - *"**The Easter service is the most important service, and the most beautiful, in the Russian Church. As Gogol once remarked, the Russians have a special interest in celebrating Easter - for theirs is a faith based on hope.** Shortly before midnight every member of the congregation lights a candle and, to the subdued singing of the choir, leaves the church in a procession with icons and banners. **There is an atmosphere of rising expectation**, suddenly released at the stroke of midnight, when the church doors open and the priest appears to proclaim in his deep bass voice ‘Christ is risen!’ - to which he receives the response from the thronging worshippers: ‘He is risen indeed!’ Then, as the choir chants the Resurrection Chant, the members of the congregation greet one another with a three-fold kiss and the words ‘Christ is risen!’ **Easter was a truly national moment - a moment of communion between the classes.**.*"
    - Chapter 5 - *"**Religious rituals were at the heart of the Russian faith and national consciousness.** They were also the main cause of a schism in the Orthodox community that split the Russian nation into two. In the 1660s the Russian Church adopted a series of reforms to bring its rituals closer to the Greek. It was thought that over time there had been deviations in the Russian liturgy which needed to be brought back into line. But the Old Believers argued that the Russian rituals were in fact holier than those of the Greek Church, which had fallen from grace by merging with Rome at the Council of Florence in 1439. In the Old Believers’ view the Greeks had been punished for this act of apostasy by the loss of Constantinople in 1453, when the centre of Orthodoxy had passed to Moscow. To the Western reader the schism may appear to be about some obscure points of ritual (the most contentious reform altered the manner of making the sign of the cross from two to three fingers) that pale into insignificance when compared with the great doctrinal disputes of Western Christendom in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. **But in Russia, where faith and ritual and national consciousness were so closely associated, the schism assumed eschatological proportions.** As the Old Believers saw it, the reforms were the work of the Antichrist, and a sign that the end of the world was near...The Old Believers refused to shave off their beards or put on Western clothes, as Peter the Great had demanded in the 1700s. They played a major role in the Cossack rebellions of the 1670s (led by Stenka Razin) and the 1770s (led by Emelian Pugachev)."*

Dostoevsky once maintained that **‘this ceaseless longing, which has always been inherent in the Russian people, for a great universal church on earth’, was the basis of ‘our Russian socialism’.** And there was a sense in which this spiritual quest lay at the heart of the popular conception of an ideal Russian state where truth and justice (pravda) were administered."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"Gogol never had religious doubts, as Tolstoy and Dostoevsky did. The torments of his final years arose only from doubts about his own merits before God. But the intense nature of the writer’s faith could not be contained within any Church....searching for a Christian brotherhood that would unite all the people in a spiritual Church. This is what he thought he had found at Optina and in the idea of the ‘Russian soul’."*

    - Chapter 5 - *"...Khomiakov came to his conception from a mystical theology. **Faith could not be proved by reasoning, he said. It had to be arrived at by experience, by feeling from within the Truth of Christ, not by laws and dogmas.** The True Church could not persuade or force men to believe, for it had no authority except the love of Christ. As a freely chosen community, it existed in the spirit of Christian love that bound the faithful to the Church - and this spirit was its only guarantee."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"The Slavophiles believed that the True Church was the Russian one. Unlike the Western churches, which enforced their authority through laws and statist hierarchies like the Papacy, Russian Orthodoxy, as they saw it, was a truly spiritual community, whose only head was Christ...**The Slavophiles were firm believers in the liberation of the serfs**: for only the communion of fully free and conscious individuals could create the sobornost’ of the True Church. **They placed their faith in the Christian spirit of the Russian people, and this was the spirit which defined their Church.** The Slavophiles believed that the Russian people were the only truly Christian people in the world...**their willingness to sacrifice their individual egos for a higher moral good** - be that for the commune, the nation or the Tsar. With all these Christian qualities, **the Russians were far more than a nationality** -they bore a divine mission in the world. In the words of Aksakov, **‘the Russian people is not just a people, it is a humanity’**."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"The concept of a national soul or essence was commonplace in the Romantic age, though Gogol was the first to give the ‘Russian soul’ this messianic turn. The lead came from Germany, where Romantics like Friedrich Schelling developed the idea of a national spirit as a means to distinguish their own national culture from that of the West. In the 1820s Schelling had a godlike status in Russia, and his concept of the soul was seized upon by intellectuals who sought to contrast Russia with Europe...Nationalists attributed a creative spontaneity and fraternity to the simple peasantry that had long been lost in the bourgeois culture of the West..After the triumph of 1812 the idea of the peasant’s soul, of his selfless virtue and self-sacrifice, began to be linked to the notion of Russia as the saviour of the West. This was the mission that Gogol first developed in Dead Souls....The closer Gogol came to the Slavophiles, the more convinced he was that this Christian brotherhood was Russia’s unique message to the world...The ‘Russian principle’ of Christian love, to be revealed by Gogol in the second and third volumes, would save humanity from the selfish individualism of the West...Even Father Makary, Gogol’s mentor at Optina, could not endorse Selected Passages. The elder thought that Gogol had not understood the need for humility...As soon as he received Makary’s letter Gogol broke off all relations with Optina. He saw that he had failed in his divine calling as a writer-prophet. He felt himself unworthy before God and began to starve himself to death."*

    - Chapter 5 - *"**At the core of the Russian faith is a distinctive stress on motherhood which never really took root in the West. Where the Catholic tradition stressed Mary’s purity, the Russian Church emphasized her divine motherhood** - the bogoroditsa - which practically assumed the status of the Trinity in the Russian religious consciousness. This cult of motherhood can easily be seen in the way that Russian icons tend to show the Madonna’s face pressed maternally against her infant’s head...In its oldest peasant form, the Russian religion was a religion of the soil....The onion dome of the Russian church was also modelled on the sun....In Russian the word for ‘red’ (krasnyi) is connected with the word for ‘beautiful’ (krasivyi) - which explains, among many other things, the naming of Red Square."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"There were different belts for every stage of life. Newborn babies were tied up with a belt...It was important for a dead man to be buried with a belt, ideally the one that he was given at his birth, to symbolize the end of the life cycle and the return of his soul to the spirit world...It was not unusual for a gentry family to observe all the strictest rituals of the Church and, without any sense of contradiction, to hold simultaneously to pagan superstitions and beliefs that any European would have dismissed as the nonsense of serfs...Peasant superstitions were also widely found among the aristocracy, even among those who would shudder at the thought of sharing any other customs with the peasantry. Stravinsky, for example, who was the perfect European gentleman, always kept a talisman that had been given to him at his birth. Diaghilev was full of superstitions which he had inherited from his peasant nanny...**The peasant nanny was without a doubt the main source of these superstitions, and such was her importance in the nobleman’s upbringing that they often loomed much larger in his consciousness than all the teachings of the Church.**."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**Orthodox and pagan - yet a rationalist: an educated Russian could be all these things. It was part of the Russian condition to master such conflicting strands within oneself and fashion out of them a sensibility, ways of living, of looking at the world that were perfectly at ease with each other.**."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"The teaching of the Gospels always remained at the core of Dostoevsky’s personality and even when, in the 1840s, he became a socialist, the type of socialism to which he subscribed had a close affinity with Christ’s ideals. He agreed with Belinsky that if Christ appeared in Russia he ‘would join the socialists...Dostoevsky’s years in the Omsk prison camp were to be the turning point of his life. They brought him face to face with the roughest and most brutal of the common people and gave him what he thought of as a special insight into the hidden depths of the Russian soul...Suddenly it seemed to Dostoevsky that all the Russian convicts had some tiny glimmer of goodness in their hearts...**Dostoevsky’s novels can be read as an open discourse between reason and belief in which the tension between the two is never quite resolved.** According to Dostoevsky, truth is contained in reason and belief - one cannot be undermined by the other - and all true belief must be maintained in the face of all reason...The ‘Russian God’ in which Dostoevsky believed could only be arrived at by a leap of faith: it was a mystical belief outside of all reasoning."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"Like Karamazov, **Dostoevsky took delight in this ‘Russian faith’, this strange capacity to believe in miracles.** It was the root of his nationalism and his messianic vision of the ‘Russian soul’ as the spiritual saviour of the rationalistic West, which ultimately led him, in the 1870s, to write in the nationalist press about the ‘holy mission’ of ‘our great Russia’ to build a Christian empire on the continent. The simple Russian people, Dostoevsky claimed, had found the solution to the intellectual’s torment over faith. They needed their belief, it was central to their lives, and it gave them strength to go on living and endure their suffering...Dostoevsky’s Orthodoxy was inseparable from his belief in the redemptive quality of the Russian peasant soul. In all his novels the quest of the ‘Great Sinner’ for a ‘Russian faith’ is intimately linked to the idea of salvation through reconciliation with the native soil. Dostoevsky’s own salvation came to him in the Siberian prison camp where for the first time he came into close contact with the common Russian people...Dostoevsky believed in a Church of social action and responsibility."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**Ivan (Karamazov) argues that, contrary to the pattern of Western history, where the Roman Church was absorbed by the state, the idea of Holy Russia was to raise the state to the level of a Church.**"
    - Chapter 5 - *"The censors banned large parts of Dostoevsky’s novel, claiming that such passages had more to do with socialism than with Christ. **It is perhaps ironic for a writer who is best known as an anti-socialist, but Dostoevsky’s vision of a democratic Church remained close to the socialist ideals which he espoused in his youth. The emphasis had changed - as a socialist he had believed in the moral need for the transformation of society, whereas as a Christian he had come to see that spiritual reform was the only way to effect social change - but essentially his quest for Truth had always been the same. Dostoevsky’s whole life can be seen as a struggle to combine the teaching of the Gospels with the need for social justice on this earth, and he thought he found his answer in the ‘Russian soul’.**"."

The Dukhobors were Tolstoyans before Tolstoy...All the core elements of ‘Tolstoyism’ - the idea that the Kingdom of God is within oneself, the rejection of the doctrines and rituals of the established Church, the Christian principles of the (imagined) peasant way of life and community - were also part of Dukhobor belief...Then, in the 1900s, the theosophists, the anthroposophists, the Symbolists, Rasputinites and mystics of all types started to see in these sects an answer to their yearning for a new and more ‘essential’ kind of Russian faith. The established Church was in danger of imploding. Politically shackled to the state, its parish life inert, if not spiritually dead, the Church could not prevent its peasant flock from running off to join sects, or fleeing to the city and the socialists, in their search for truth and justice on this earth...If Tolstoy’s Christian anarchism was motivated by the yearning to belong to a free community of Christian love and brotherhood, the personal root of his religion was a fear of death which became more intense with every passing year. Death was an obsession throughout his life and art."*

    - Chapter 5 - *"In 1897 Tolstoy paid a visit to Chekhov. The playwright was gravely ill...When Tolstoy arrived at the clinic, six days after the haemorrhage, he found Chekhov sitting up in bed in a cheerful mood, laughing and joking, and coughing blood into a large beer glass. Chekhov was aware of the danger he was in - he was a doctor, after all - but he kept his spirits up, and even talked of plans for the future. Tolstoy, Chekhov noted with his usual cutting wit, was ‘almost disappointed’ not to find his friend at the point of death. It was clear that Tolstoy had come with the intention of talking about death. He was fascinated by the way that Chekhov seemed to accept death and just get on with life, and, envious of this calm attitude perhaps, he wanted to know more...In fact, Chekhov said, he did not understand life after death. He saw no point in thinking about it, or in comforting oneself, as he put it, with ‘delusions of immortality...Here was the crucial difference between the two men. When Tolstoy thought of death his mind turned to another world, while Chekhov’s always returned to this one."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**It was not that Chekhov was an atheist - although in the last years of his life he claimed to have no faith. His religious attitudes were in fact very complex and ambivalent. Chekhov had grown up in a religious family and throughout his life he retained a strong attachment to the rituals of the Church. He collected icons. At his house in Yalta there was a crucifix on his bedroom wall. He liked reading about the Russian monasteries and the lives of saints. From his correspondence we learn that Chekhov loved to hear church bells, that he often went to church and enjoyed the services, that he stayed at monasteries, and that on more than one occasion he even thought of becoming a monk himself.** Chekhov saw the Church as an ally of the artist, and the artist’s mission as a spiritual one. As he once said to his friend Gruzinsky, ‘the village church is the only place where the peasant can experience something beautiful...**But he did embrace the concept of religion as a way of life - a basic moral code - which is what it was for him and what he thought it was for the simple Russian man.**."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"...Chekhov discusses **this Russian need for faith.**...She wants to know why famous Russian writers all find faith before they die. **‘As I understand it, faith is a gift of the spirit. It is a talent: you have to be born with it. As far as I can judge, speaking for myself, and from all that I have seen, this talent is present in the Russian people to the highest degree. Russian life represents an endless series of beliefs and enthusiasms, but it has not, if you ask my advice, it has not yet gone anywhere near not believing or rejecting belief. If a Russian person does not believe in God, it means he believes in something else.'...This was close to Chekhov’s view - and he himself was very Russian in this sense...he never once lost sight of the need for Russians to believe. For without faith in a better world to come, life in Chekhov’s Russia would be unendurable.**."*
    - Chapter 5 - *"**Chekhov understood that people die in a very ordinary way - for the most part they die thinking about life. He saw that death is simply part of the natural process - and when death came to him, he met it with the dignity and courage, and the same love of life, he had always shown.**...For Tolstoy, death was no such easy thing...**The fearless attitude of the peasant towards death was a commonplace of nineteenth-century Russian literature. ‘What an astonishing thing is the death of a Russian peasant! His state of mind before death could be called neither one of indifference, nor one of stupidity; he dies as if he is performing a ritual act, coldly and simply.’**..They didn’t puff themselves up or fight against it or brag that they were going to die - they took death calmly. They didn’t shirk squaring things up, they prepared themselves quietly and in good time, deciding who should have the mare, who the foal, who the coat and who the boots, and they departed easily, as if they were just moving into a new house."*

Breadcrumbs would be scattered on the graves to feed the birds - symbols of the souls that rose up from the ground and flew around the village during Easter time - and if the birds arrived it was taken as a sign that the spirits of the dead were alive and well...The Russian grave was much more than a place of burial.

Take off your hats!’ Everyone obeyed the Christian ritual and, after hesitating for a moment, the police kneeled down too and removed their caps.**."*

    - Chapter 6 "Descendants of Genghis Khan" - *"**Many Russian families had Mongol origins. ‘Scratch a Russian and you will find a Tatar,’ Napoleon once said.** The coats of arms of Russian families - where Muslim motifs such as sabres, arrows, crescent moons and the 8-pointed star are much in evidence - bear witness to this Mongol legacy. There were four main groups of Mongol descendants. First there were those descended from the Turkic-speaking nomads who had swept in with the armies of Genghiz Khan in the thirteenth century and settled down in Russia following the break-up of the ‘Golden Horde’. **Among these were some of the most famous names in Russian history: writers like Karamzin, Turgenev, Bulgakov and Akhmatova; philosophers like Chaadaev, Kireevsky, Berdiaev; statesmen like Godunov, Bukharin, Tukhachevsky; and composers like Rimsky-Korsakov.** Next were the families of Turkic origin who came to Russia from the west: the Tiutchevs and Chicherins, who came from Italy; or the Rachmaninovs, who had arrived from Poland in the eighteenth century. **Even the Kutuzovs were of Tatar origin - an irony in view of the great general Mikhail Kutuzov’s status as a hero made of purely Russian stuff.** Families of mixed Slav and Tatar ancestry made up a third category. Among these were some of Russia’s grandest dynasties - the Sheremetevs, Stroganovs and Rostopchins - although there were many at a lower level, too...The final group were Russian families who changed their names to make them sound more Turkic, either because they had married into a Tatar family, or because they had bought land in the east and wanted smooth relations with the native tribes...**Adopting Turkic names became the height of fashion at the court of Moscow between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the Tatar influence from the Golden Horde remained very strong and many noble dynasties were established. During the eighteenth century, when Peter’s nobles were obliged to look westwards, the fashion fell into decline.**."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"**In its defining myth Russia had evolved as a Christian civilization, its culture was a product of the combined influence of Scandinavia and Byzantium.** The national epic which the Russians liked to tell about themselves was the story of a struggle by the agriculturalists of the northern forest lands against the horsemen of the Asiatic steppe. This national myth had become so fundamental to the Russians’ European self-identity that even to suggest an Asiatic influence on Russia’s culture was to invite charges of treason. In the final decades of the nineteenth century, however, cultural attitudes shifted. As the empire spread across the Asian steppe, there was a growing movement to embrace its cultures as a part of Russia’s own."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"**It is hard to overstress the sense of national shame which the ‘Mongol yoke’ evokes in the Russians.** Unless one counts Hungary, Kievan Rus’ was the only major European power to be overtaken by the Asiatic hordes...By and large, then, the Mongol occupation was a story of the Russian princes’ own collaboration with their Asiatic overlords. This explains why, contrary to national myth, relatively few towns were destroyed by the Mongols; why Russian arts and crafts, and even major projects such as the building of churches, showed no signs of slowing down; why trade and agriculture carried on as normal; and why in the period of the Mongol occupation there was no great migration by the Russian population from the southern regions closest to the Mongol warriors...According to the national myth, the Mongols came, they terrorized and pillaged, but then they left without a trace. **Russia might have succumbed to the Mongol sword, but its Christian civilization, with its monasteries and churches, remained unaffected by the Asiatic hordes. This assumption has always remained central to the Russians’ identity as Christians. They may live on the Asiatic steppe but they face towards the West. ‘From Asia’, wrote Dmitry Likhachev, the leading twentieth-century cultural historian of Russia, ‘we received extraordinarily little’ - and his book, called Russian Culture, has nothing more to say on the Mongol legacy.**...**Karamzin, in his History of the Russian State, did not write a thing about the cultural legacies of Mongol rule.**...**The great historian Sergei Soloviev devoted just three pages to the cultural influence of the Mongols in his 28-volume History of Russia. Even Sergei Platonov, the leading nineteenth-century Mongol scholar, suggested that the Mongols had no influence on Russian cultural life.**."*

    - Chapter 6 - *"**The Mongol occupation left a profound mark on the Russian way of life. As Pushkin wrote to Chaadaev in 1836, it was then that Russia became separated from the West. That history posed a fundamental challenge to the Russians’ European self-identification...Pushkin’s willingness to embrace this legacy was exceptional, given the taboo which Asia represented to the educated classes of Russia at that time.**...**But Russian Europhiles like Chaadaev found nothing to impress them in the Mongol legacy. Seeking to explain why their country took a separate path from Western Europe, many Russians blamed the despotism of the Mongol khans. Karamzin pointed to the Mongols for the degeneration of Russia’s political morals.**...Herzen said that Nicholas I was ‘Genghiz Khan with a telegraph’ - and, continuing in “that tradition, Stalin was compared to Genghiz Khan with a telephone. **The Russian autocratic tradition had many roots, but the Mongol legacy did more than most to fix the basic nature of its politics.**."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"...Boris Godunov was the other Tsar descendant of the Golden Horde...This Mongol descent was clearly visible in Lenin’s looks."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"**But Turkic phrases also left their mark on the language of the street - perhaps most notably in those ‘davai’ verbal riffs which signal the intention of so many daily acts: ‘davai poidem’ (‘Come on, let’s go’), ‘ davai posidim’ (‘Come on, let’s sit down’), and ‘ davai popem’ (‘Come on, let’s get drunk’).**."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"**All the major tribes of Central Asia - the Kazakhs, the Uzbeks, the Kalmyks and Kirghiz - were offshoots of the Golden Horde**. With the dissolution of the Horde in the fifteenth century, they had remained on the Russian steppe and became the allies or the subjects of the Tsar. The ancestors of the Kazakhs - Islamic-Turkic Mongols - left the Golden Horde in the fifteenth century. Gradually they became closer to the Russians."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"...**The cathedral was far more than a symbol of Russia’s victory over the Mongol khanates. It was a triumphant proclamation of the country’s liberation from the Tatar culture that had dominated it since the thirteenth century. With its showy colours, its playful ornament and outrageous onion domes, St Basil’s was intended as a joyful celebration of the Byzantine traditions to which Russia now returned.**...The cathedral was originally named the Intercession of the Virgin -to mark the fact that Kazan was captured on that sacred feast day (Pokrova) in 1552. Moscow’s victory against the Tatars was conceived as a religious triumph, and the empire which that victory launched was in many ways regarded as an Orthodox crusade. The conquest of the Asiatic steppe was portrayed as a holy mission to defend the Church against the Tatar infidels. It was set out in the doctrine of Moscow as the Third Rome - a doctrine which St Basil’s cast in stone - whereby Russia came to see itself as the leader of a truly universal Christian empire built on the traditions of Byzantium...It is equally telling that the word in Russian for a peasant (krestianin), which in all other European languages stems from the idea of the country or the land, is connected with the word for a Christian (khristianin)."*

    - [The Russian Discovery of Siberia](https://www.loc.gov/collections/meeting-of-frontiers/articles-and-essays/exploration/russian-discovery-of-siberia/)
    - Chapter 6 - *"**This religious conquest of the Asiatic steppe was far more fundamental to the Russian empire than the equivalent role such missions played in the overseas empires of the European states. The explanation for this is geography. There was no great ocean to divide Russia from its Asian colonies: the two were part of the same land mass. The Ural mountains, which officially divided the European steppe from the Asiatic one, were physically no more than a series of big hills with large tracts of steppeland in between, and the traveller who crossed them would have to ask his driver where these famous mountains were. So without a clear geographical divide to distinguish them from their Asian colonies, the Russians looked instead to cultural categories. This became especially important in the eighteenth century, when Russia sought to redefine itself as a European empire with a presence in the West. If Russia was to be styled as a Western state, it needed to construct a clearer cultural boundary to set itself apart from this Asiatic other’ in the Orient. Religion was the easiest of these categories. All the Tsar’s non-Christian tribes were lumped together as ‘Tartars’, whatever their origins or faith...Nowhere were the Russians more concerned to erect cultural boundaries than in Siberia...This pessimistic vision of Siberia was reinforced by its transformation into one vast prison camp.**."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"**The cultural importance of the Ural mountains for Russia’s European self-identification has persisted to this day - as testified by the notion of a Europe ‘from the Atlantic to the Urals’ advanced by Gorbachev.**."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"**But Russian attitudes toward the East were far from being all colonial. Politically, Russia was as imperialist as any Western state. Yet culturally there was a deep ambivalence, so that in addition to the usual Western stance of superiority towards the ‘Orient’ there was an extraordinary fascination and even in some ways an affinity with it. Much of this was a natural consequence of living on the edge of the Asiatic steppe, torn between the counter-pulls of East and West. This ambiguous geography was a source of profound insecurity - mainly in relation to the West, though such feelings were always the mainspring of Russia’s wavering attitude towards the East as well. The Russians might define themselves as Europeans in relation to Asia, but they were ‘Asiatics’ in the West.**."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"Trade and intermarriage were universal forms of cultural interchange on the Siberian steppe, but the further east one went the more likely it became that the Russians were the ones who would change their ways. In Yakutsk, for example, in north-east Siberia, ‘all the Russians spoke in the Yakut language'..Such a thing would never have occurred in the overseas empires of the European states, at least not once their mode of operation had been switched from trade to colonial mastery. For, with a few exceptions, the Europeans did not need to settle in their colonies...The Russian Empire developed by imposing Russian culture on the Asian steppe, but in that very process many of the colonizers became Asian, too. **One of the consequences of this encounter was a cultural sympathy towards the colonies that was rarely to be found in colonizers from the European states.**."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"This ‘Orient’ was not a place that could be found on any map. It was in the south, in the Caucasus and the Crimea, as well as in the east. The two compass points of south and east became combined in an imaginary ‘Orient’ - an exotic counter-culture in the Russian imagination - and it was made up as a sort of pot-pourri from many different cultural elements...Long before the Russians ever knew their colonies as ethnographic facts, they had invented them in their literature and arts. The Caucasus occupied a special place in the Russian imagination, and for much of the nineteenth century, as the Tsar’s armies struggled to control its mountainous terrain and fought a bloody war against its Muslim tribes, Russian writers, artists and composers identified with it in a romantic way. The Caucasus depicted in their works was a wild and dangerous place of exotic charm and beauty, where the Russians from the north were strikingly confronted by the tribal cultures of the Muslim south. It was Pushkin who did more than anyone to fix the Russian image of the Caucasus. He reinvented it as the ‘Russian Alps’, a place for contemplation and recuperation from the ills of urban life...For Russia’s young Romantics, who were looking for a source to distinguish Russian culture from the West, Sismondi’s theory was a revelation. Suddenly, it seemed, the Russians had their own ‘south’ in the Caucasus, a unique colony of Muslim-Christian culture whose possession brought them closer to the new Romantic spirit than any of the nations of the West...Lermontov once said that Russian poetry would find its destiny by ‘following the East instead of Europe and the French'."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"For Stasov the significance of the Eastern trace in Russian art went far beyond exotic decoration. It was a testimony to the historical fact of Russia’s descent from the ancient cultures of the Orient. Stasov believed that the influence of Asia was ‘manifest in all the fields of Russian culture: in language, clothing, customs, buildings, furniture and items of daily use, in ornaments, in melodies and harmonies, and in all our fairy tales...Suddenly the origins of the byliny had become the battleground for opposing views of Russia and its cultural destiny. On the one side there was Stasov, who argued that the pulse of ancient Asia was still beating in the Russian villages; and on the other the Slavophiles, who saw the byliny as living proof that Russia’s Christian culture had remained there undisturbed for many centuries."*

In this way the empire would expand on the ‘Russian principle’ of ‘peaceful evolution and assimilation’ rather than by conquest and by racial segregation, as in the empires of the European states."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"The idea that Russia had a cultural and historic claim in Asia became a founding myth of the empire. During the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the 1890s, Prince Ukhtomsky, the press baron and adviser to the young Tsar Nicholas II, advocated the expansion of the empire across the whole of the Asian continent, reasoning that Russia was a sort of ‘older brother’ to the Chinese and the Indians. ‘We have always belonged to Asia,’ Ukhtomsky told the Tsar. ‘We have lived its life and felt its interests. We have nothing to conquer.’ Inspired by the conquest of Central Asia, Dostoevsky, too, advanced the notion that Russia’s destiny was not in Europe, as had so long been supposed, but rather in the East: Russia is not only in Europe but in Asia as well...This mistaken view of ourselves as exclusively Europeans and not Asians (and we have never ceased to be the latter)… has cost us very dearly over these two centuries, and we have paid for it by the loss of our spiritual independence… It is hard for us to turn away from our window on Europe; but it is a matter of our destiny… When we turn to Asia, with our new view of her, something of the same sort may happen to us as happened to Europe when America was discovered. For, in truth, Asia for us is that same America which we still have not discovered. With our push towards Asia we will have a renewed upsurge of spirit and strength…“This quotation is a perfect illustration of the Russians’ tendency to define their relations with the East in reaction to their self-esteem and status in the West.'.. Dostoevsky was not actually arguing that Russia is an Asiatic culture; only that the Europeans thought of it as so. **And likewise, his argument that Russia should embrace the East was not that it should seek to be an Asiatic force: but, on the contrary, that only in Asia could it find new energy to reassert its Europeanness. The root of Dostoevsky’s turning to the East was the bitter resentment which he, like many Russians, felt at the West’s betrayal of Russia’s Christian cause in the Crimean War, when France and Britain had sided with the Ottomans against Russia to defend their own imperial interests..Dostoevsky portrayed the Crimean War as the ‘crucifixion of the Russian Christ’.**.*"

    - Chapter 6 - *"Folk dance, too, according to Trubetskoi, had much in common with the dancing of the East, especially that of the Caucasus. Russian dancing was in lines and circles, rather than in pairs, as in the Western tradition. Its rhythmic movements were performed by the hands and shoulders as well as by the feet. The male dancing was virtuosic, as exemplified by the Cossack dance, with heels hitting fingers and high jumps. There was nothing like this in the Western tradition...“Female dancing also showed an Eastern character, with great importance placed on keeping the head still and on subtle doll-like movements by the rest of the body. All these cultural forms were seen by Trubetskoi as the Russian manifestations of a distinctively Eastern inclination for schematic formulae. This ‘Eastern psyche’ was manifested in the Russian people’s tendency to contemplation, in their fatalistic attitudes, in their love of abstract symmetry and universal laws, in their emphasis on religious ritual, and in their ‘udal’ or fierce bravery."*
    - Chapter 6 - *"..Russia and the East have been indissolubly linked from as early as the Tatar invasions, and the spirit of the Tatars, of the East, has become so rooted in our life that at times it is difficult to distinguish where a national feature ends and where an Eastern influence begins.."*
    - Chapter 7 "Russia Through the Soviet Lens" - *"**The February Revolution had swept away, not just the monarchy, but an entire civilization.** The liberals and moderate socialists like Alexander Kerensky, who formed the Provisional Government to steer the country through to the end of the First World War and the election of a Constituent Assembly, had assumed that the Revolution could be confined to the political sphere. **But almost overnight all the institutions of authority collapsed - the Church, the legal system, the power of the gentry on the land, the authority of the officers in the army and the navy, deference for senior figures - so that the only real power in the country passed into the hands of the local revolutionary committees (that is, the Soviets) of the workers, peasants and soldiers.** It was in their name that Lenin’s Bolsheviks seized power in October 1917 and instituted their Dictatorship of the Proletariat.**They consolidated their dictatorship by leaving the war and buying peace with Germany. The cost of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed in March 1918, was one-third of the Russian Empire’s agricultural land and more than half its industrial base, as Poland, the Baltic territories and most of the Ukraine were given nominal independence under German protection. Soviet Russia, as a European power, was reduced to a status comparable to that of seventeenth-century Muscovy. From the remnants of the Imperial army, the Bolsheviks established the Red Army to fight against the Whites (a motley collection of monarchists, democrats and socialists opposed to the Soviet regime) and the interventionary forces of Britain, France, Japan, the USA and a dozen other western powers which supported them in the civil war of 1918-21.**."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"Popularly seen as a war against all privilege, **the practical ideology of the Russian Revolution owed less to Marx - whose works were hardly known by the semi-literate masses - than to the egalitarian customs and Utopian yearnings of the peasantry.** Long before it was written down by Marx, the Russian people had lived by the idea that surplus wealth was immoral, all property was theft, and that manual labour was the only true source of value."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"Palaces like the Fountain House were sub-divided and made into apartment blocks. Soon after their seizure of power, the Bolsheviks unleashed a campaign of mass terror, encouraging the workers and the peasants to denounce their neighbours to Revolutionary Tribunals and the local Cheka, or political police...In this climate of mass terror no private space was left untouched."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"Gorky took up the defence of the starving Petrograd intelligentsia, pleading with the Bolsheviks, among whom he was highly valued for his left-wing commitment before 1917, for special rations and better flats...owed their survival of these hungry years to Gorky’s patronage."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"The Fountain House was only one of many former palaces to be converted into communal apartments after 1917...**Nothing better illustrates the everyday reality of the Revolution than this transformation of domestic space. The provincial gentry were deprived of their estates, their manor houses burned or confiscated by the peasant communes or the local Soviet, and the rich were forced to share their large apartments with the urban poor or to give up rooms to their old domestic servants and their families. This Soviet ‘war against the palaces’ was a war on privilege and the cultural symbols of the Tsarist past. But it was also part of a crusade to engineer a more collective way of life which lay at the heart of the cultural revolution in the Soviet Union. By forcing people to share communal flats, the Bolsheviks believed that they could make them communistic in their basic thinking and behaviour. Private space and property would disappear, the patriarchal (‘bourgeois’) family would be replaced by communist fraternity and organization, and the life of the individual would become immersed in the community.**."*

Lenin was deeply influenced by the ideas of the physiologist Ivan Sechenov, who maintained that the brain was an electromechanical device responding to external stimuli..To produce a new, ‘improved version’ of man - that is the future task of communism. And for that we first have to find out everything about man, his anatomy, his physiology and that part of his physiology which is called his psychology...**It was Stalin who first used the famous phrase, in 1932, about the artist as the ‘engineer of the human soul'...Since they believed that consciousness was shaped by the environment, they focused on forms of art, like architecture and documentary film, photomontage and poster art, designs for clothes and fabrics, household objects and furniture, which had a direct impact on people’s daily lives.**."*

    - Chapter 7 - *"The Constructivists were in the forefront of this movement to bring art into union with life. In their founding manifestos, written during 1921, they detached themselves from the history of art, rejecting easel painting and other such artistic modes as individualistic and irrelevant to the new society; as ‘constructors’ and ‘technicians’, they declared their commitment, by contrast, **to the design and production of practical objects which they believed could transform social life.** To this end, Varvara Stepanova and Vladimir Tatlin designed workers’ clothes and uniforms. Stepanova’s designs, which were strongly geometric and impersonal, broke down the divisions between male and female clothes. Tatlin’s designs subordinated the artistic element to functionality. A man’s spring coat, for example, was designed to be light yet retain heat, but it was made out of undyed material and lacked decorative design. Alexander Rodchenko and Gustav Klutsis used photomontage to smuggle agitation into commercial advertisements and even packaging. El Lissitzky designed simple, lightweight furniture capable of being mass produced for standard use. It was versatile and movable, as necessitated by the ever-changing circumstances of the communal house. His folding bed was a good example of the Constructivist philosophy."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"The Proletkult (Proletarian Culture) movement was equally committed to the idea of the artist fostering new forms of social life. ‘A new science, art, literature, and morality....is preparing a new human being with a new system of emotions and beliefs.'"*
    - Chapter 7 - *"Yet there was also the Utopian faith that a new culture would be built on the rubble of the old. The most committed members of the Proletkult were serious believers in the idea of a purely Soviet civilization that was entirely purged of historical and national elements. This ‘Soviet culture’ would be internationalist, collectivist and proletarian. There would be a proletarian philosophy, proletarian science and proletarian arts. Under the influence of such ideas, experimental forms of art appeared. There were films without professional actors, orchestras without conductors and concerts in the factory...**But was it possible to construct a new culture without learning from the old? How could one have a ‘proletarian culture’, or a ‘proletarian intelligentsia’, unless the proletariat was first educated in the arts and sciences of the old civilization? And if they were so educated, would they, or their culture, still be proletarian?** The more moderate members of the Proletkult were forced to recognize that they could not expect to build their new culture entirely from scratch and that, however Utopian their plans, much of their work would consist of educating workers in the old culture."*

    - Chapter 7- *"Lenin, a conservative in artistic matters, had always been appalled by the cultural nihilism of the avant-garde...he could not understand or derive any pleasure from works of modern art. His cultural politics were firmly based on the Enlightenment ideals of the nineteenth-century intelligentsia, and **he took the view that the Revolution’s task was to raise the working class to the level of the old elite culture.** **‘We must preserve the beautiful, take it as a model, use it as a starting point, even if it is “old”. Why must we turn away from the truly beautiful just because it is “old”? Why must we bow low in front of the new, as if it were God, only because it is “new”?**.*"
    - Chapter 7 - *"**In their habits and artistic taste, the Russian masses appeared to be resistant to the experiments of the avant-garde. There was little real enthusiasm for communal housing, which never escaped its associations with grim necessity. Even the inhabitants of commune houses rarely used their social space: they would take their meals from the canteen to their beds rather than eat them in the communal dining room. In the Moscow Soviet’s model commune house, built in 1930, the residents put up icons and calendars of saints on the dormitory walls. The unlifelike images of the avant-garde were just as alien to a people whose limited acquaintance with the visual arts was based on the icon.**."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"**’For us the most important of all the arts is cinema,’ Lenin valued film above all for its propaganda role.**...Trotsky said the cinema would compete with the tavern and the church: it would appeal to a young society, whose character was formed, like a child’s, through play...**'The theatre is a game. The cinema is life'..It was the realism of the photographic image that made film the ‘art of the future’ in the Soviet Union. Other art forms represented life; but only cinema could capture life and reorganize it as a new reality.**....The group declared war on the fiction films of the studios, the ‘factory of dreams’ which had enslaved the masses to the bourgeoisie, and **took their camera out on to the streets to make films whose purpose was to ‘catch life as it is’ - or rather, insofar as their aim was ‘to see and show the world in the name of the proletarian revolution’, to catch life as it ought to be.**."*

    - Chapter 7 - *"**This manipulative element was the fundamental difference between the kinoki and what would become known as cinema verite in the Western cinematic tradition: cinema verite aspired to a relatively objective naturalism, whereas the kinoki arranged their real-life images in a symbolic way. Perhaps it was because their visual approach was rooted in the iconic tradition of Russia.**...**Vertov, like all the Soviet avant-garde directors, wanted cinema to change the way its viewers saw the world. To engineer the Soviet consciousness, they hit upon a new technique - montage. By intercutting shots to create shocking contrasts and associations, montage aimed to manipulate the audience’s reactions, directing them to the ideas the director wanted them to reach.**...Lev Kuleshov was the first director to use montage in the cinema - long before it was adopted in the West...According to Kuleshov, **it was through the montage of contrasting images that cinema could create meaning and emotions in the audience.**....All the other great Soviet film directors of the 1920s used montage: Dziga Vertov, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Boris Barnet and, in its most intellectualized form, **Sergei Eisenstein**. **Montage was so central to the visual effect of Soviet experimental cinema that its exponents were afraid that their medium would be destroyed by the arrival of film sound.**..Montage required a different kind of acting, capable of conveying the meaning of the film quickly and economically."*

    - Chapter 7 - *"The horse had long been a symbol of apocalypse in the Russian intellectual tradition. Before 1917 it had been used by the Symbolists to represent the Revolution, whose imminence they sensed....According to Lenin, the events of July had transformed the Revolution into a civil war, a military struggle between the Reds and the Whites. He campaigned for the seizure of power by claiming that Kerensky would establish his own Bonapartist dictatorship if the Soviet did not take control. All these ideas are involved in Eisenstein’s image of the falling horse. It was meant to make the audience perceive the suppression of the July demonstrations, as Lenin had described it, as the crucial turning point of 1917."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"..He also used montage to extend time and increase the tension - as in The Battleship Potemkin (1925), in the famous massacre scene on the steps of Odessa in which the action is slowed down by the intercutting of close-ups of faces in the crowd with repeated images of the soldiers’ descent down the stairs. The scene, by the way, was entirely fictional: there was no massacre on the Odessa steps in 1905."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"..Nor was this the only time when history was altered by the mythic images in Eisenstein’s films. When he arrived at the Winter Palace to shoot the storming scene for October, he was shown the left staircase where the Bolshevik ascent had taken place. But it was much too small for the mass action he had in mind, so instead he shot the scene on the massive Jordan staircase used for state processions during Tsarist times. The Jordan staircase became fixed in the public mind as the October Revolution’s own triumphant route. **Altogether Eisenstein’s October was a much bigger production than the historical reality. He called up 5,000 veterans from the civil war - far more than the few hundred sailors and Red Guards who had taken part in the palace’s assault in 1917. Many of them brought their own guns with live ammunition and fired bullets at the Sevres vases as they climbed the stairs, wounding several people and arguably causing far more casualties than in 1917. After the shooting, Eisenstein recalled being told by an elderly porter who swept up the broken china: ‘Your people were much more careful the first time they took the palace.'**."*
    - Chapter 7 - *"**This was the Soviet paradise Zamyatin satirized in his novel We, which depicts a futuristic world of rationality and high technology, with robot-like beings who are known by numbers instead of names and whose lives are controlled in every way by the One State and its Big Brother-like ruler, the Benefactor. Zamyatin’s novel was the inspiration of George Orwell’s 1984.**."*

    - *"On dokuzuncu yüzyıl ortalarının Rusya’sı nereye yöneleceğini bilemez: Batı’ya mı yoksa Doğu’ya mı, Avrupa’ya mı yoksa Asya’ya mı; Petersburg’a, kültürün içine mi, yoksa bozkırdaki köylere mi? Turgenyev onu ileri doğru itiyor, Tolstoy ise geri çekiyordu. Herkes tedirgindi. Çarlık doğrudan komünist bir anarşiyle karşı karşıyaydı, eskilerden kalma Ortodoks inancı atlayarak fanatikçe ve çılgın bir ateizme sıçramıştı. Hiçbir şey kesin değildi...Dostoyevski’nin kahramanları, gerçek Ruslardır, geçiş dönemi insanlarıdır, kalplerinde başlangıcın kaosu vardır...Ama harika olan şudur: Bir başlangıcın insanları olduğu için her birinde dünya bir kez daha başlar. Bizde çoktan soğuk kavramlara dönüşüp donmuş olan sorular henüz onların kanlarında kor halinde durmaktadır. Bizim kenarlarında ahlaki çitleri ve etik işaret levhalarıyla üzerinde çok yürünmüş rahat yollarımız onlara yabancıdır: Her yerde ve her zaman çalılıkların arasından geçerek sınırsız olana, sonsuz olana doğru yürürler. Hiçbir yerde kesin bilgi kuleleri, güven köprüleri yoktur: Tümüyle kutsal ilk devirler dünyasıdır bu. Her birey, Lenin ve Troçki’nin Rusya’sında olduğu gibi, bütün dünya düzenini yeniden kurmak zorunda olduğunu hisseder ve işte Rus insanının kendi kültürüne çakılıp kalmış Avrupa için anlatılamaz değeri budur, burada hiç kullanılmamış bir merakın hayata dair bütün soruları sonsuzluğa bir kez daha sormasıdır. Bizim iyice hantallaştığımız yerlerde onların henüz kor halinde olmasıdır. Dostoyevski’nin kahramanlarının her biri bütün problemleri yeniden gözden geçirir, iyinin ve kötünün sınır taşlarını kendi kanayan elleriyle taşır, her biri kendi kaosunu yeniden dünya haline getirir. Henüz içlerinde başlangıcın kaosu vardır, ama ilk ışığın yaratıldığı günün şafağı ve şimdiden, yeni insanın yaratılacağı altıncı günün önsezisi de vardır. Onun kahramanları yeni bir dünyanın öncüleridir: Dostoyevski’nin romanı yeni insanın mitosu ve onun Rus ruhundan doğuşudur....Hepsinde de dehalarının ve elmas gibi berrak zihinlerinin yanında, bir çocuk kalbi, bir çocuk neşesi vardır: Onlar şunu ya da bunu değil, her şeyi isterler. Hepsini de olanca yoğunluğuyla. İyiyi ve kötüyü, sıcağı ve soğuğu, uzağı ve yakını....Dostoyevski’nin ortadan kaldırdığı ilk sınır, gözlerimizin önüne serdiği ilk uzaklık Rusya’ydı. O dünya adına ülkesini keşfetti, Avrupalı bilincimizi genişletti, Rusların ruhunu ilk kez bir fragman olarak, evrensel ruhun en değerli unsurlarından biri olarak idrak etmemizi sağladı....Hayatı hayatın anlamından daha çok sevin."*
