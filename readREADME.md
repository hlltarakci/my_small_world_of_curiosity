  - [x] [**Three masters: Balzac - Dickens - Dostoyevski**](https://www.amazon.com/Three-masters-Balzac-Dickens-Dostoevsky/dp/B0939Z4HHW) - *"On dokuzuncu yüzyıl ortalarının Rusya’sı nereye yöneleceğini bilemez: Batı’ya mı yoksa Doğu’ya mı, Avrupa’ya mı yoksa Asya’ya mı; Petersburg’a, kültürün içine mi, yoksa bozkırdaki köylere mi? Turgenyev onu ileri doğru itiyor, Tolstoy ise geri çekiyordu. Herkes tedirgindi. Çarlık doğrudan komünist bir anarşiyle karşı karşıyaydı, eskilerden kalma Ortodoks inancı atlayarak fanatikçe ve çılgın bir ateizme sıçramıştı. Hiçbir şey kesin değildi...Dostoyevski’nin kahramanları, gerçek Ruslardır, geçiş dönemi insanlarıdır, kalplerinde başlangıcın kaosu vardır...Ama harika olan şudur: Bir başlangıcın insanları olduğu için her birinde dünya bir kez daha başlar. Bizde çoktan soğuk kavramlara dönüşüp donmuş olan sorular henüz onların kanlarında kor halinde durmaktadır. Bizim kenarlarında ahlaki çitleri ve etik işaret levhalarıyla üzerinde çok yürünmüş rahat yollarımız onlara yabancıdır: Her yerde ve her zaman çalılıkların arasından geçerek sınırsız olana, sonsuz olana doğru yürürler. Hiçbir yerde kesin bilgi kuleleri, güven köprüleri yoktur: Tümüyle kutsal ilk devirler dünyasıdır bu. Her birey, Lenin ve Troçki’nin Rusya’sında olduğu gibi, bütün dünya düzenini yeniden kurmak zorunda olduğunu hisseder ve işte Rus insanının kendi kültürüne çakılıp kalmış Avrupa için anlatılamaz değeri budur, burada hiç kullanılmamış bir merakın hayata dair bütün soruları sonsuzluğa bir kez daha sormasıdır. Bizim iyice hantallaştığımız yerlerde onların henüz kor halinde olmasıdır. Dostoyevski’nin kahramanlarının her biri bütün problemleri yeniden gözden geçirir, iyinin ve kötünün sınır taşlarını kendi kanayan elleriyle taşır, her biri kendi kaosunu yeniden dünya haline getirir. Henüz içlerinde başlangıcın kaosu vardır, ama ilk ışığın yaratıldığı günün şafağı ve şimdiden, yeni insanın yaratılacağı altıncı günün önsezisi de vardır. Onun kahramanları yeni bir dünyanın öncüleridir: Dostoyevski’nin romanı yeni insanın mitosu ve onun Rus ruhundan doğuşudur....Hepsinde de dehalarının ve elmas gibi berrak zihinlerinin yanında, bir çocuk kalbi, bir çocuk neşesi vardır: Onlar şunu ya da bunu değil, her şeyi isterler. Hepsini de olanca yoğunluğuyla. İyiyi ve kötüyü, sıcağı ve soğuğu, uzağı ve yakını....Dostoyevski’nin ortadan kaldırdığı ilk sınır, gözlerimizin önüne serdiği ilk uzaklık Rusya’ydı. O dünya adına ülkesini keşfetti, Avrupalı bilincimizi genişletti, Rusların ruhunu ilk kez bir fragman olarak, evrensel ruhun en değerli unsurlarından biri olarak idrak etmemizi sağladı....Hayatı hayatın anlamından daha çok sevin."*

The possibility of escape -- after four months, after two years -- always seems to be there, and yet when it comes time to make a decision it's easier just to continue as before."* - This book helped me to change mindset during my first reading.
