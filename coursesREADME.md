- [ ] [ONLINE][COURSERA: Russian History: from Lenin to Putin, by Peter Kenez (3 weeks)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/russian-history-lenin-putin/home/week/1)
    - Peter Kenez: *"History does not in fact repeat itself. **Life is complicated.** Every historical event is complicated not to be sure there are patterns. To be sure human beings are very much in very many things are alike. But the most important, the most interesting aspect is how they are different and so are historical events. More than that, it has always seemed to me that looking for lessons in history are more likely to lead to trouble, because we are bound to learn the wrong lessons...Stalin may have been as wicked a human being as Hitler. He may have had as many victims for which he was responsible as Hitler, but they were not alike. They were different. They had different goals. However terrible things Stalin did to his own people, he had no aggressive intent in his mind...**Circumstances are different. Circumstances change.** So, if I start out by saying that there are no lessons, why do it, why study history? The reason for that is because what we learn from history is how human beings behaved in certain set of circumstances...We gain a broader understanding of humanity, of whom we are. And that may not necessarily, but may lead to wisdom. Will we be able to make better decisions as a result of having acquired wisdom? I hope so. I think it does make a difference. We would be able to evaluate a new set of circumstances because we have learned something about the varieties of humanity, the extraordinary circumstances in which human beings have acted and performed. Why study Russian history in particular? It seems to me that Russia is and has been a part of Europe. When we are talking about the Russian history we are talking about European history. And indeed, **the history of the 20th century begins with the Russian revolution in 1917, and it ends with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The short 19th century in some sense, definitely, Russia was at its center. It seems to me that the Russian revolution has changed not only Russia, but the Western world. It seems to me that the Nazis would not have come to power without the Russian revolution of 1917. What I have in mind is not so much that individual right wing Russians after the revolution went to Germany and participated in extreme right wing movements, but because the German people were afraid of the threat of Marxism and communism which allowed Hitler and Hitler's followers to prosper. I think the attitude of the Western world for making social changes was greatly enhanced by the fear of communism. And it seems to me that Russia is very much part of the European world, of the Western world. Now, it seems to me that the greatness of European civilization is that separate individual national cultures coexisted and enriching one another, responding to one another. And Russia was very much part of this process. It's difficult for me to imagine European culture without the great Russian writers, without Russian scientists, Russian musicians. And, of course, the Russians were responding to Europe... But, more than that, I have always been particularly attracted to the study of Russian history because it shows extreme circumstances, because it shows how human beings behaved in extraordinary circumstances and so many other major issues.**.."*
    - Lecture "Formation of the Russian State: *"And the great dividing line is 1861, the liberation of the serfs. And indeed, one should discuss Russian history in these terms, how did serfdom develop, and what were the consequences of serfdom, and the ending of serfdom? Because it seems to me that serfdom is the essential social fact of Russian history which has significance very much going into Soviet times. The remarkable thing that serfdom developed relatively late. Indeed at a time when the the feudal obligations in the rest of Europe became lighter ultimately diminished and disappeared. How did this develop? Well, two aspects led up to it. One is the impoverishment of the peasantry. The other part was because of the policies of the state...The only way that the Tsar could pay his army is giving them land. The problem was that the land by itself was not very valuable because you needed people to cultivate that land...in 1651, all free movement of the peasants were suspended, and peasants came to be tied to their land...The nobility never and couldn't have that sense of unity which Western European nobility's had for several reasons. First of all, because it was ethnically diverse. But they acquired their power through service of the Tsar as opposed to having ancient connections to certain segments of the land...What developed was a bureaucracy, a group of people who served the state and the Tsar...That is, Russia was very lightly governed. The bureaucracy never developed esprit de corps, the sense of public service was never there...**At the beginning of the 18th century, was beginning of a division and that division was between Russians, who on the one hand, believed that Russia is an independent, separate civilization who should follow a path different from the rest of Europe, versus another group who were attracted by what Europe had to offer. And from that point on, arguably to our days, there is this fundamental division among in Russian intellectual life.**...And then in 1861, serfdom was abolished by the state, why?  **It seems to me, however, that the liberation of the serf was fundamentally a spiritual decision. That is, the Russian rulers lost faith in the morality of keeping people serfs.** .. Now the abolition of serfdom was really fundamental fact because all institutions of the Russian state were based on serfdom...City councils came into being very late in the life of the Russian state, in the last decades of the 19th century. But fundamentally, this was a major change in every aspect of Russian life... **Nonetheless, the beginning of industrialization we can date with serf liberation. Without serf liberation, the Great Industrialization, which took place at the end of the century, could not have happen.**..."*
